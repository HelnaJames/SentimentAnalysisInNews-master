have n't started yet
have been poor
will have to start soon if we
want to win anything
were installed as the bookmakers '
were routed 4-0
lost their opening league game
were again a shadow
have every right to be unhappy
did n't cut us
had a lot
will be heard at the Old Trafford headquarters
failed to bring them
was fitting that Italian Gianluca Vialli
DESPAIRS AS MONEY
look a poor side
can stop goals
've conceded
were committing suicide
could have got beaten by more
is that Newcastle
withstood the pressure
was proof
's probably the worst performance
should score his first premier league goal
came to Chelsea from Juventus without a lira
is now a couple
will sound familiar
threw away valuable points
joined the Tynesiders
emblazoned on the back by the truckload
silenced his doubters
opted to return to the city
have re-instated themselves
beat Wimbledon
should need it
