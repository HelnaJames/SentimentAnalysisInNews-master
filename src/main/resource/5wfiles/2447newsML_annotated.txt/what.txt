is confused about its North Korea policy
knows this , but is playing along that line to receive public support
took power in 1993

were playing up the North Korean threat
are really pro-North Korea
have totally broken down
have remained technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict
helped end military-backed rule and usher
have proposed four-party peace talks
is too violent and extreme
abandoned their socialist leanings
have now alienated ordinary South Koreans
