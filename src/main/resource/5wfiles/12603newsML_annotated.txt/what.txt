was content to play himself
cost 10 runs
earned an ironic cheer
delivered his first dot ball
has already equalled his previous test and looks well capable of becoming the sixth Pakistan batsman
did at least find a better line
tightened the screws
added another 89 runs
moved relentlessly towards the first double century
was unbeaten on 169 not out
was guilty of some ill-judged petulance when he
could make a breakthrough
continued to offer scant assistance
shoved Anwar
edged a widish delivery
