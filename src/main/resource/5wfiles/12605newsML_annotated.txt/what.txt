turned his game
had some inspired moments
did n't win a game
was not moving a lot
was n't feeling very good on the court
started holding my
got a little bit and played well in the third set
serve
went on a run , winning the first five games
started I and I
's the kind
defeated compatriot Alex O'Brien
's played since Wimbledon
returned serve solidly to hand O'Brien his first loss
has made the quarterfinals
took the first set
played solid tennis
had a lot break-point chances
knew that if I
kept the pressure
would eventually get a break
hile it
looked like Rios
is that he
entered the Canadian Open
could n't get his serve-and-volley game
think the best part
puts so much pressure
