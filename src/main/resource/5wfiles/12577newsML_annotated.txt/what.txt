turned his ankle
turned quickly with his foot
was able to come back to play but did not show the consistency
to win six straight games
was surprised he
came back
hit a winner
knew it
tried to keep Voinea
extended Damm through five match points , two in the 10th game of the third set and three more in the final game
erased the first four but missed the baseline
won semifinal matches
eliminated unseeded Adrian Voinea
do n't know how I
'll feel
'll ask for a Tuesday start
sprained ankle 5-7
beat unseeded Karol Kucera , Slovakia
swept the tiebreaker
won the last five games
looked bad
was n't that bad
