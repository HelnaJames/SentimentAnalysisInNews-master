rallied past Sandrine Testud 7-6
handled herself in front of the media
led 4-3 in the decisive third set and used a lone service break
laced a backhand pass
thought towards the end
was down in the tiebreaker
serve
was n't really aggressive enough
was hoping I
would make all the mistakes
happened to play some very good shots
've played her several times
think if I , she
had to compare her
was in the Top 10
's making more unforced errors and looks like she serve
was n't able to put much pressure
would say
was not in good form today
did n't play smart in the opening set but managed to prevail against the world 's 40
did n't expect Sandrine Testud
told her after the match
happened to be a little and a little at the end to win the whole match
thought it
was a really unbelievable match
to play so well
deserves all the credit
played unbelievable
ran down so many of my balls
sailed through the opening
explained
has teamed to win 15
questioned too many line
'm not agreeing with anything
play her three times
beat her
have nothing against her
do n't think it
had something to say
should have come to me
was fair because it
's not true
have to play your
doubles partner
led 4-2 before committing five straight errors
hurt me
does n't matter because I and I
happens sometimes you
combined an effective
was very happy with the way
played
'm looking good
needed a decisive service break
must focus on playing Novotna
is still not happy with the way Novotna
went into a tiebreaker
can say
can not say
