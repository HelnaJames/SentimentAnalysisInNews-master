test their limits for days over a perilous wilderness course
has been staged twice before -- in Utah and Maine last year -- and is modelled on similar races overseas
is being held near Pemberton , British Columbia , about 100 miles -LRB- 165 km -RRB- northeast of Vancouver
is filled with treacherous mountain peaks , ice fields and frigid waters
expect about two-thirds of the participants to drop out or be disqualified before the finish
race in teams of five which must include both men and women
carrying about 40 pounds -LRB- 18 kg -RRB- of gear on their backs
'm looking forward to this race
'll have to go up against more diverse situations due to the terrain
