going back to work before the government
are not going back
will not respond to any threats to dismiss us
told state radio
justify their 60 percent pay rise
pressed on with a strike to sack them
persisted
would remain on the streets until their demands
were met
returned to work
could not afford to back down
addresses our grievances
would consider their grievances
rejects the offer and says a majority
had told officials
is a rare challenge
has left many state hospitals
