will meet No. 4 Kimiko Date
sleep-walked through the first-set drubbing before awakening with her pesky ground game to get past the world 's 6
was snapping out of her funk
are the body
have less than 12 hours to recover before the next match
have to able to deal with everything
can run down so many balls
can get to the point and give you back
can last a long time
's such a good runner
slammed an overhead winner
broke again to claim the hard-fought victory
won because I
have guts and confidence
was a very close match
had to fight and be able to come with good shots to win
was definitley the better player
GETS LATE WAKEUP CALL
TO MOVE INTO FINAL
dashed the hopes
was on the defensive all the time
wanted to attack
tried to be very aggressive
missed a lot
offered a tougher challenge
came back to 4-4
was a little
felt I and could keep myself
was in good form
had my chances
played badly at 5-4
lost my
serve
held and broke for 6-5 before holding at love
spotted doubles partner and No. 3 seed
's when I
was still sleeping
woke up
do n't like to play at nine or 10 o'clock
fight til the end
am lucky to be in the final
's what I
's not enough
's what basically happened to me
missed her wake but recovered in time to gain the final
laughed
was falling further into fatigue after playing her second match
was irritated but refused to blame the poor scheduling
have to start all over again
started really well , got tired and could never get out of it
understand television and they
am
have no complaints
has its needs
want to have certain players
happens
