has failed to gain any meaningful momentum and is unlikely to do so in the near future
was at 1.4900 marks off Thursday 's
was little changed at 108.40 on dollar/mark
shot up to 1.4950 marks to the rate cut but failed to break above and quickly fell back
is also somewhat gloomy
is still going to be vulnerable
cut does nothing
will remain lifeless
came as a total surprise where the most bullish forecasts
are more or less appropriately valued somewhere around 105
has problems both on the fiscal side and the trade side
do n't see much strength
're comfortable with
can not do it
is difficult to see what will
