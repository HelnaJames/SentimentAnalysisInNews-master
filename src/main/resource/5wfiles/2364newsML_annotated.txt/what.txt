built just yards
has been carefully recreated from historical records and what could be gleaned from excavation
do not claim that this
can do in 1996
look forward to it
will be selling cushions
was built in 1599 , just as the prologue
predates the scheduled official opening
will include women
has raised critics '
will depart drastically from Shakespearian traditions
is the best
first welcomed us
hoped that working before a live audience would help show up anything
got wrong
were like when first peformed
were staged during his lifetime
worked under in the 16th and 17th centuries
is a replica
is the realisation
was being put in place
would be stolen by another theatre
is it
is symbolic
was written before the original Globe
were the first actors
had waged a 40-year battle
is still central
wanted to put together
was to recreate , as far as possible
begins a risky experiment
standing
had little time to learn their roles and would not have seen the full script
feels permeated with a sense
