Where in the world is Taiwanese Vice-President Lien Chan?:Neutral
The question has perplexed journalists, nervous stock market investors and ordinary citizens since Lien, a dapper, U.S.-educated millionaire who doubles as premier or cabinet chief, dropped from sight in New York on Sunday.:Negative
Lien's whereabouts are laden with portent for Taiwan's strained ties with longtime rival China, which surely is as curious as anyone about his movements.:Positive
Taiwan's government knows where he is, acknowledging that Lien is making a private visit to a country where Taiwan has no diplomatic ties, apparently in Europe.:Negative
But officials have bent over backward to keep Lien's travels secret, knowing Beijing will savage any diplomatic friend that accords anything resembling an official welcome to a leader of what Beijing regards as Taiwan's illegitimate government.:Negative
