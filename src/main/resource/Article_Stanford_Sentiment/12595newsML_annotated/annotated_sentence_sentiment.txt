CRICKET-ENGLAND SERIES HOPES SUBMERGED BY RAIN.:Negative
Rain left England up the creek without a paddle on Saturday when less than three hours were possible between the showers on the third day of the final test against Pakistan at the Oval.:Negative
Pakistan had reached 339 for four when the weather intervened for the final time, giving them a lead of 13 runs with two days remaining to safeguard their 1-0 lead in the three-test series.:Negative
The heavy showers submerged any faint chance England had of fighting their way back into an improbable winning position, but at least saved the home bowlers from possible further embarrassment.:Negative
When Pakistan resumed after lunch on 318 for two, with Saaed Anwar unbeaten on 169, the omens looked distinctly unpromising for an England attack operating on a flat strip.:Negative
