Buba cut does nothing for dollar, outlook gloomy.:Negative
The dollar's failure to get above technical resistance pegged around 1.4950-60 marks in the wake of the Bundesbank's money market interest rate cut is disappointing and the general feeling is that it will remain lifeless, foreign exchange analysts said on Friday:Very negative
"The dollar has failed to gain any meaningful momentum on the back of the Bundebank's larger than expected rate cut and is unlikely to do so in the near future," said Klaus Baader, senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.:Negative
"In our view the short-term risks are now very much skewed to the downside for dollar/mark.":Negative
At 0730 GMT the dollar was at 1.4900 marks, half a pfennig off Thursday's European close of 1.4960.:Negative
On the yen it was little changed at 108.40 against Thursday's 108.46 with the focus firmly on dollar/mark.:Negative
