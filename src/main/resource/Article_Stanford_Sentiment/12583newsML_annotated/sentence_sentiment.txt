974 km track cannot decide the outcome of the championship, but could be highly-influential, particularly if Hill wins and extends his advantage:Negative
But on Saturday's evidence the outcome may be decided, as often in the past, by the manner in which the drivers cope with the capricious weather in the Ardennes:Neutral
Villeneuve had dominated from the start of the session, wrenching the psychological ascendancy away from Hill, whose name has been linked with a possible move to McLaren next season by the paddock rumour machine:Neutral
Three times the Canadian was fastest while Hill only headed qualifying twice during the dry 35-minute spell:Neutral

"I know it sounds childish, but that is what I did: I learned it with a new video game and it is pretty much like the real thing:Positive
"Asked where he had qualified in the video game, he said he had been "around 18th or something -- not on pole:Negative
"Hill said there was always a certain amount of pain in being beaten, but pointed out that it had been frustrating for him as he could not go out and use his final set of qualifying tyres because of the wet weather:Negative
He also expressed some reservations about his position for the start -- uphill on the outside of the grid -- following three poor front row getaways at recent races:Negative
But he said he felt he had found the perfect set-up for his car without being able to explore it fully:Positive
"Pole is important here, but not as important as at some other places," he admitted, adding that even if he made a good start, he might find it difficult to make the best use of it on the slippery outside line into the hairpin at the first corner:Negative
