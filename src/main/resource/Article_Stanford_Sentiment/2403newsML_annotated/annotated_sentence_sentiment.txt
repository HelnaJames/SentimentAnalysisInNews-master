Polish firms' July earnings just up after weak H1.:Negative
Firms listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange recorded slightly better July earnings after a weak first half, but analysts said it was too early to tell if there would be an earnings rebound this year.:Negative
In July, 48 firms on the main and parallel markets showed a real net profit growth year-on-year compared with 34 firms over the first six months:Negative
"July earnings were average, but better than the weak results recorded in May and June, so they're returning to normal rather than worsening," said Pawel Tarnowski, an analyst at Raiffeisen Capital and Investment.:Negative
Analysts had attributed the lower profits in the first four months of the year to this year's long winter.:Negative
But they said unspectacular May and June earnings had hastened the downward correction that followed the main market's 90-percent rise this year to a 27-month high of 14,282.2 points on July 5.:Negative
