5 percent and mabe even four percent in a year's time but the tankan has radically shifted the trading range," saidShah, based in London:Negative
The Bank of Japan's quarterly corporate survey or "tankan" released earlier in Tokyocaughtfinancial marketson the hop:Negative
The key diffusion index for major manufacturers -- which gauges business sentiment -- fell to minus seven in August from minus three in May:Negative
Analysts had been expecting a slight rise:Neutral
Paul Meader, who manages 200 million pounds ($311:Negative
5 million) in fixed-income investments at Matheson Investment Management in London, added, "The curve is very steep and that makes me feel perhaps international managers may start to look at extending up the curve a little bit:Negative
"Bond markets surged in Japan and held onto gains in London:Positive

75 percent as his target:Neutral
But troubles loom beyond the short term, analysts said:Negative
While Japan's Finance Minister Wataru Kubo said the tankan would not lead to any immediate decision on the need for an extra budget, analysts said the urge may prove irresistable, particularly with an election due by mid-1997:Negative
"This weak economic scenario increases scope for another fiscal stimulus package and the budget deficit will become even more horrendous and supply will hit the market some time down the road," Shah said:Negative
Meader added that with one of largest budget deficits of developed countries, interest rates at rock bottom and the yen continuing weak, the economy already had plenty of stimulus:Negative
"From a bond market perspective that fiscal stimulus, interest rate stimulus and currency stimulus is a very dangerous cocktail and it justifies real yields much higher and nominal yields much higher," he said:Positive
Meader said Matheson may increase its weighting slightly in JGBs from its slim eight percent weighting:Neutral
The JP Morgan global bond index has a benchmark of 15 percent, he said:Negative
But Shah would opt for U:Neutral
