3 million):Neutral
Newcastle were installed as the bookmakers' favourites to win their first championship since 1927, and the club's merchandise shop was selling black and white striped team shirts with Shearer's name emblazoned on the back by the truckload:Negative
Inside a month, the optimism of early August has vanished:Neutral
First, Newcastle were routed 4-0 by Manchester United in the Charity Shield, then they lost their opening league game at Everton:Negative
Shearer silenced his doubters with a superb goal from a free kick in midweek as Keegan's side beat Wimbledon but on Saturday they were again a shadow of the team that so nearly won the league last year:Positive
"The fans have every right to be unhappy," Keegan said:Positive
"At the moment everyone has got the right to say we look a poor side:Positive
The only way we can stop goals at the moment is to board them up:Neutral
"You can't legislate for the two goals we've conceded:Neutral
They were down to sloppy defending:Negative
In the end we were committing suicide out there and we could have got beaten by more:Negative
"To anyone who saw Newcastle last season, Keegan's complaints will sound familiar:Negative
Exhilarating in attack, they threw away valuable points in last year's epic league tussle with Manchester United through poor defending and inexplicable lapses in concentration:Negative

But since then they have re-instated themselves as the bookmakers' favourites to lift their fourth championship title in five years with a series of impressive performances:Positive
On a day when all Newcastle's riches failed to bring them points, it was fitting that Italian Gianluca Vialli should score his first premier league goal:Negative
A player with all the class of Shearer, even if he is now a couple of years past his prime, Vialli came to Chelsea from Juventus without a lira changing hands:Negative
His goal in Chelsea's 2-0 triumph over Coventry was proof, if Keegan should need it, that hard cash alone cannot buy success:Negative
