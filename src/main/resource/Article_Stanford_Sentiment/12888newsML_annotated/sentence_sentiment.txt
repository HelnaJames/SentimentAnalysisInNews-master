"We are prepared for a long haul to do that," Bass Brewers' chiefIain Napiertold Reuters, commenting on what would happen if the deal went to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC):Negative
Buthewashopeful that there would be a speedy resolution to any MMC inquiry-- within an eight to nine month period:Neutral
"We've tried to keep the regulator informed all the waythrough this deal," saidNapier:Negative
"We are hopeful that they can say there's nothing wrong with what we're doing:Negative
"Bass announced earlier the long-awaited purchase of Allied Domecq's 50 percent stake in Carlsberg-Tetley for 200 million stg:Negative
Carlsberg has agreed to contribute its interests and 20 million stg in exchange for a 20 percent share of the combined Bass Brewers and Carlsberg-Tetley business:Neutral
The agreement gives Bass 35 percent of the British beer market and, according to rival brewing group Whitbread, makes a referral to the MMC likely:Negative

Napier said Bass would have to look at all the options available to it in the event of a referral:Neutral

We will then decide from a business perspective whether or not that makes sense for us and what that mix of options are," he said:Negative
Whitbread suggested brands may be released:Neutral
Bass is to take a one-off cost of 75 million pounds for restructuring the combined business following the merger of Carlsberg-Tetley with Bass Brewers:Negative
Napier said this would go towards achieving the efficiencies which would result in the 90 million pounds annual savingsoutlined earlier by Bass:Neutral
He said there would be redundancies:Negative
"There will be some redundancy costs of course, I'd be naive to suggest there wouldn't:Negative
We hope that redundancies will be lower with us than they would have been with C-T because they would have to have taken some action anyway," said Napier:Negative
He said he did not know how many job losses there would be:Negative
"We hope that by bringing together another company we'll be able to get synergistic benefit out of that:Positive
