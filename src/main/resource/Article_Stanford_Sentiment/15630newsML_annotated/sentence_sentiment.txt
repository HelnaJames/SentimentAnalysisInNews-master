British strikes show unions retain clout -TUC boss:Neutral
Alan RaybouldLONDON 1996-08-27A spate of high-profile strikes in Britain this summer has shown that, despite 17 years of hostile government legislation, thetrade unionsare still a force to bereckonedwith, theleader of Britain's unionssaid on Tuesday:Negative
"Trade unionism is still around, and still capable of having a scrap,"John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), told Reuters in an interview:Negative
Mail workers haveheld a series of one-day strikes in a dispute overworking arrangements, and London underground railway drivershave staged short stoppagesfor a better pay and hours deal:Negative
Monks pointed out theprivate sectorhad been affected, too, withdisputesatBritish Airways and Peugeot:Negative
"Theeconomyisgetting better, and there are opportunities, at least for some workers, to say it's about time our interests were taken more into account by employers,"Monkssaid:Positive
Some experts believe the Labour Party's lead of around 20 points in the opinion polls ahead of an election to be held by mid-1997 has also helped restore union confidence:Positive
Labour leader Tony Blair has reduced the unions' influence over the party and has refused to repeal Conservative anti-union laws enacted since 1979, but he is pledged to the introduction of a minimum wage and industrial relations changes:Negative
Monks said the TUC "genuinely welcomed" Labour's pledge to sign up for the European Union's Social Chapter, which guarantees minimum working conditions, and other promises such as greater union recognition rights:Positive
The TUC will be lobbying for a more positive attitude towards Europe from a Labour government:Neutral
"We stand unabashed on the pro-European side of the argument, including on the single currency," Monks said:Negative
Staying outside but shadowing the single currency would mean "you accept all the disciplines without the influence", he said:Negative
Staying outside and floating, on the other hand, would carry high risks:Positive
"The likely costs include higher interest rates in this country and probably some kind of surcharge on British exports into the single market," Monks said:Negative
To the annoyance of some unions, Labour has declined to fix a figure for the national minimum wage, and will instead set up a commission, with union and employer members, to advise on a level after the election:Negative
The TUC holds its annual conference next month and Monks said various figures would be put forward for debate, from 3:Negative
70 pounds ($5:Neutral
77) to 4:Neutral
26 pounds ($6:Neutral
64) an hour:Neutral
Another source of embarrassment for Labour will be calls for the renationalisation of the railways, or at least of RailTrack, which owns the tracks and stations:Negative
Reluctantly, most unions accept that Labour will have better things to do with scarce public funds than renationalise everything privatised by the Conservatives since 1979:Negative
But Monks said: "There's still a strong feeling in the Congress, and that should be expressed this year, that the railways should be publicly owned, or certainly the track -- the Railtrack part of it -- should be:Positive
""We'll be making demands for some renationalisation in the rail industry:Neutral
A publicly-owned railway is a popular concept and one we hope we could persuade Labour to look afresh at:Positive
" ($1=:Neutral
