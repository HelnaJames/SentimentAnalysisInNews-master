TOKYO 1996-08-20Economic datafor Japanimproved slightlyin June, but economists said thenation's recoverydoes not look like it will be moving out of the slow laneanytime soon:Negative
Japan's index of leading indicators, which was designed to help predict economic developments over the next six months stood at 70 in June, over the key 50 mark for the third month in a row, theEconomic Planning Agency (EPA)said on Tuesday:Negative
A figure below the so-called "boom or bust" mark of 50 is generally taken assuggestingthe economywill contract in the coming months, while a figure above 50 suggests the economy will expand:Negative
Moreover, thecoincident index, which measures current economic conditions, stood at 55,upfrom 30 in May andabove50 for the first time since February:Negative
But economists pointed out that the strength in the data, which is compiled by comparing figures from three months before, was largely relative:Negative
"The June figure was based on March data which was quite weak:Negative
Today's data confirm that the economic recovery is still moderate," said Satoshi Shimamoto, an economist at MMS International:Negative
An EPA official said improvements in economic barometers related to industrial output were responsible for the lift in the coincident data and that continued improvement in July would also depend on how well output would do:Negative
"If industrial output rises 4:Neutral
2 percent, then conditions will not be so severe," he said:Negative
The government has forecast a month-on-month rise of 4:Positive
2 percent in output for July after it dropped a preliminary four percent in June:Negative
Industrial output data for July will be released at the end of August:Negative
Analysts said the government forecast for July was not too far out of line:Negative
In general output was recovering gradually and could be expected to do so for the time being, they said:Negative
"It will probably rise by two percent for rest of this year," said Tod Wood, an economist at ING Baring Securities, adding that was in line with a modest economic recovery:Positive
But analysts also noted there were few factors on the horizon that called for a more upbeat assessment of the economy:Negative
A slow but steady comeback in consumption and healthy corporate capital spending plans have been heralded as new stimulants for recovery but an expected drop in public works spending this autumn will somewhat counter those good effects, they said:Negative
Japan's economy started recovering earlier this year after recording four years of near-zero growth, propelled in part by a massive 14 trillion yen public works spending plan announced last September:Negative
