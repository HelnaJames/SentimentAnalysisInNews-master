They must think there is areasonable risk of that happeningotherwise why have a plan B in place," saidRalph Findlay, finance director of Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries:Negative
On Sunday Bass confirmed details of a long-awaited deal to merge with Carlsberg-Tetley, leaving Danish brewer Carlsberg with a 20 percent stake in a merged Carlsberg-Tetley-Bass if British regulators allow the marriage to take place:Negative

"If it doesn't work it seems plan B comes into operation:Negative
But it is by no means clear what will invoke plan B," Findlay said:Negative

"Because Bass and Allied have dominated the beer supply in those areas since the Second World War:Positive
""In those areas they are the two biggest brewers and the two biggest brewers getting together in very significant regions like that is something which has never happened before:Negative
