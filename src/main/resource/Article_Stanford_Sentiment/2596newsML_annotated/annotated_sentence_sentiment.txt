Talks resume in German retail pay dispute.:Neutral
German retail workers' unions on Tuesday resumed regional talks with shopowners aimed at agreeing a wage and work hours deal to cope with the liberalisation of German shopping hours in November.:Negative
As the HDE retail industry association pleaded for a swift end to the deadlock on the talks, the HBV services union, in the second day of talks for North Rhine-Westphalia's 450,000 retail workers, said it was hopeful a deal could be struck.:Negative
Unions are pressing for broader adoption of a regional deal struck in Rhineland-Palatinate which called for workers to get a 1.85 percent wage rise plus 20 percent extra time in lieu per hour worked after 6:30 p.m. weekdays and 2:00 p.m. Saturdays.:Negative
Employers, hit by weak consumer spending, have baulked at accepting the Rhineland-Palatinate deal, and are particularly wary of the 20 percent allowance.:Negative
However HBV's chief negotiator for North Rhine-Westphalia, Gerhard Keuchel, said there were "strong chances" for agreement during Tuesday's talks taking place in the town of Marl.:Neutral
