The $14:Neutral
4:Neutral
billion merger of MFS Communication Co Inc and WorldCom Inc, announced Monday, owes its conception to recent U:Negative
S:Neutral
deregulation legislation:Neutral
"This merger is really driven by theneed to strengthenthemselvesin their newly opened-up home market," saidJohn Matthews, for high-technology research consultancy Ovum:Negative
The merged company will have sales of about $5:Neutral
4 billion a year, with more than 500,000 business customers throughout North America, Europe and Asia:Neutral
But the merger will havebig repurcussionsin Europe, where some national telephone monopolies, due to expire in 1998, present a tempting combination ofbloated prices and workforces and complacent management:Negative
MFS-WorldCom is also seen as a powerful competitor which could even take business away from some of the big, global groupings:Neutral
These comprise Global One - with Deutsche Telekom AG , France Telecom and Sprint Corp of the U:Negative
S:Neutral
- British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Corp's Concert, and the Unisource partnership led by ATT T:Negative
But in Europe, experts say the combination of MFS, with its burgeoning networks of fibre optic cables in major financial centres, allied with WorldCom's expertise in long-distance services will give it powerful leverage at the top end of the market:Negative
This is the corporate market, where the management of giant companies telecommunications and data processing is big business:Negative
"Taking large corporate clients in large financial centres and shipping their traffic around the world is superior cream skimming - clotted cream skimming really, attacking the highest value market," said David Roffey, who leads PA Consulting's telecommunication strategy team:Negative
Roffey said the fit between MFS and WorldCom makes sense:Neutral
MFS has local networks, particularly in the U:Positive
S:Neutral
, and WorldCom has expertise in long-distance line leasing:Neutral
In Europe the new combination will be taking aim at the currently protected and over-priced national markets which become liberalised in 1998:Neutral
"Some European telephone costs are huge and so are the price discrepancies:Positive
A medium volume private high-speed circuit in Italy is 17 times more expensive than in Sweden:Negative
That sort of range - and even a price level of twice is probably unsustainable - won't last when competition like MSF-WorldCom gets going," Roffey said:Negative
Matthews, principal consultant at Ovum, said this threat to the least efficient European operators could be exaggerated, while profits at the top end of the market are themselves being held back by increasing competition:Negative
"Certainly there will be losers after deregulation:Neutral
The smaller and weaker national companies that relied on monopoly over 100 years in some cases, but they were threatened anyway by the opening of the market," Matthews said:Negative
And the top of the market is not necessarily still a license to print money:Negative
"It was very true five years ago, but high end customers are being saught by so many, they're not as profitable as they used to be," Matthews said:Neutral
