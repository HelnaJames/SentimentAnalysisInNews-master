London's Globe, an experiment in theatre history:Neutral
Helen SmithLONDON 1996-08-20In a theatre open to London's often rainy skies, a troupe of actors begins a risky experiment on Wednesday to discover what William Shakespeare's plays were like when first peformed 400 years ago:Negative
The Globe Theatre is a replica of the 20-sided wood-and-thatch arena which Shakespeare part-owned and where his finest works, including "Macbeth," "Hamlet" and "King Lear", were staged during his lifetime:Positive
It is therealisation of the dreamofAmerican actor-director Sam Wanamaker, who died of cancer in 1993, just as thetheatre's wooden framework was being put in place:Negative
Wanamaker had waged a 40-yearbattle againstbureacracyandcommercial greedto get thenew Globebuiltjust yards (metres) from the site of the original on the south bank of the Thames, opposite St Paul's Cathedral:Negative
His vision is still central to the 30 million pound ($46 million) Globe, which begins a "prologue season" on Wednesday with a production of "Two Gentlemen of Verona:Neutral
""Anyone who worked with Sam was very much influenced by what he wanted to put together," said Lennie James, who plays one of the "Two Gentlemen:Positive
"Interviewed under grey skies in the Globe's auditorium on Tuesday, James said the place feels permeated with a sense of history:Negative
"When (artistic director Mark Rylance) first welcomed us onto the stage saying we were the first actors in 400 years to stand here, I got a real buzz," he said:Positive
Wanamaker's aim was to recreate, as far as possible, the conditions that Shakespeare's actors worked under in the 16th and 17th centuries:Negative
The audience, many of them standing, would have been crowded around the stage ready to heckle the actors and punish bad performances with volleys of rotten fruit:Negative
The actors had little time to learn their roles and would not have seen the full script, which was kept carefully guarded for fear that it would be stolen by another theatre:Negative
The Globe has been carefully recreated from historical records and what could be gleaned from excavation of the original, destroyed in 1644 by England's puritan rulers:Negative
But little is still known about the theatres of the day:Neutral
Rylance said he hoped that working before a live audience would help show up anything the historians got wrong:Neutral
"We do not claim that this is it," said the boyish Rylance:Negative
"This is the best we can do in 1996:Positive
There's bound to be more evidence and we look forward to it:Positive
"Notwithstanding his search for authenticity, Rylance's production will depart drastically from Shakespearian traditions:Negative
The cast of "Two Gentlemen of Verona" will include women and black actors, both unheard of in Shakespeare's day, and the play is set in modern Italy:Positive
Even less traditional, the Globe will be selling cushions for the hard seats and raincoats -- thunderstorms are in the weather forecast for the opening night:Negative
The choice of "Two Gentleman of Verona", one of Shakespeare's lesser-known plays, has raised critics' eyebrows, but Rylance says it is symbolic:Negative
It was written before the original Globe was built in 1599, just as the prologue predates the scheduled official opening of its successor in June 1997, he said:Negative
