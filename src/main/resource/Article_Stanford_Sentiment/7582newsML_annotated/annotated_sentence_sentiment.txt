Greek Socialists give PM ok for September poll.:Negative
Greece's ruling socialist (PASOK) party gave Prime Minister Costas Simitis the green light on Thursday to hold snap elections in September and the exact date will be announced later after a cabinet meeting.:Negative
"PASOK's executive bureau agreed unanimously with a proposal by the prime minister for an (early) election," PASOK general secretary Costas Skandalidis told reporters.:Negative
"Mr Simitis will make statements after the cabinet meeting.":Negative
Government officials said that the most probable dates for the snap poll were September 22 or 29 and that Simitis would cite as reasons the economy and tense relations with Turkey.:Negative
Elections are not due until October 1997 but Simitis, one of Greece's most popular politicians, wants a new four-year term to push through tough economic decisions aimed at bringing Greece in line with its European Union partners.:Neutral
An election win would also give him a free hand to deal with neighbour Turkey on wrangles over territorial rights in the Aegean Sea which brought the two countries close to war earlier this year.:Negative
