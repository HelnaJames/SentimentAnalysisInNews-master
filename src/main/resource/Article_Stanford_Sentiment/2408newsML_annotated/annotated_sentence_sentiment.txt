Slovak c.bank moves failing to hit target - analysts.:Negative
Measures by the National Bank of Slovakia to ease the country's money supply may not be working, as a mounting liquidity surplus continues to drive prices down on the money market, analysts said on Tuesday.:Negative
They said the market's burgeoning liquidity, which is seen driving  rates down by some two percentage points to about 10 percent on all maturities, points to the ineffectiveness of the NBS's recent moves to take money out of circulation.:Negative
"The central bank will have to take other measures to stem the money supply, as the effect of the tool it chose to do so is partly eliminated by short-term foreign capital inflows," Jozef Bozek of Tatra Banka told Reuters:Negative
