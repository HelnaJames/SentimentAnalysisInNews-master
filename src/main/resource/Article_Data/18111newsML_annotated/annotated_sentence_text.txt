Approval for Lloyd's settlement offer edges closer.
Final approval for Lloyd's of London's recovery plan edged closer on Wednesday as it declared that over 90 percent of members had accepted a settlement offer aimed at securing the 300-year-old insurance market's future.
Lloyd's said it had been swamped by U.S. investors signing up for its recovery plan after a U.S. appeals court overturned a ruling that had threatened the insurance market's survival
 By Wednesday afternoon 66.7 percent of U.S. members had accepted.
The level of acceptances speaks for itself.
Members have made their views toward the reconstruction of Lloyd's abundantly clear," Lloyd's chairman David Rowland said in a statement.
