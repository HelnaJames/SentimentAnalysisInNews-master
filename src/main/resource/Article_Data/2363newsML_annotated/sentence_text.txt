Complaints surge overUK "demonic" political ads
LONDON 1996-08-20A British industry watchdogsaid on Tuesday it had been flooded withcomplaintsabout anadvertising campaignthat depicted opposition Labour leader Tony Blair with demonic eyes
TheAdvertising Standards Authority(ASA) told Reuters it had received about 100 complaints and would decide in a few days whether thecampaignbroke rulesthat ban offensive ads and those that unfairly infringe on the privacy of public figures
If the rules werebreachedby theads, which were run by the incumbent Conservative Party in British newspapers this month, the ASA willbanthe ads
"Theadvertising industryitself doesn't wantpolitical advertisingtodegenerateinto mud-slinging," anadvertising industry sourcetold Reuters
The ASA has received written responses to the complaints from M&amp;C Saatchi, the advertising agency that created the campaign and that was started last year by Maurice Saatchi and his brother, Charles
The Saatchi brothers were ousted in December 1994 from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, which they formed in 1970
The ads showed Tony Blair with a manic grin and red demonic eyes gleaming out from behind a black strip
British newspapers this week quoted the actor whose eyes were used for the ads, Scott Woods, as saying he was upset about the campaign
He told newspapers he had known photos of his eyes were being used for a Conservative Party campaign, but not that they would be used to make Blair look evil
Woods, who specialises in playing serial killers, pirates and demons because of his mad, staring eyes, said he was a Labour supporter and planned to vote for Blair
