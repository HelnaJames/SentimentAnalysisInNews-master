SwissdismissInternet referendumsas toorisky
BERNE 1996-08-20Swiss leaders on Tuesdayrejected callsto hold the country's frequentnational referendumson the Internet, sayingcomputer networkswerevulnerable to sabotage
The Federal Council, or cabinet,dismisseda parliamentary requestfor a study of ways for Swiss voters to cast their ballots electronically over the world-wide computer network
Internet votingwould be toovulnerable to manipulationby computer hackers, since the Internet is accessible from almost any computer,the cabinetsaid
"Thisdangeris much greater in a computer network, and especially in the Internet, than under current voting methods," it said, referring to the ballot papers and boxes now in use
Internet voting would also requireenormous investmentin technology to make it available to all, the cabinet added
Six members of parliament had urged the government to look into Internet balloting as a way of luring non-voting Swiss, especially younger people, back into the democratic process
Voter turnout has fallen gradually for years at the same time as the number of referendums has mushroomed under Switzerland's system of direct democracy
Swiss citizens are able to vote directly on many major policy issues rather than delegating them to elected representatives, as happens in most other democracies
A given year might see five to 10 national referendums and even more local ones
