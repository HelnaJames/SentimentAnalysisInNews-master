Oil price rally stalls after hitting 4-month high.
World oil prices fell slightly on Tuesday as traders mulled over their next move after a month-long rally which has taken prices to four-month highs.
On London's International Petroleum Exchange, which was closed for a holiday on Monday, October futures for North Sea benchmark Brent Blend crude shed 38 cents to $20.04 a barrel.
London's declines follow a similar slide on Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) where profit-takers pushed crude lower.
On Tuesday, October NYMEX crude futures lost just six cents to $21.56 per barrel.
Traders said a downward correction was probably needed after the sharp gains posted so far in August
