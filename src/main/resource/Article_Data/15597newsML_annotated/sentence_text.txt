The relatively high oil price has stunned many analysts who had predicted price weakness given record-high oil output and the prospect of more supplies when Iraqi oil exports return under a United Nations plan allowing Baghdad to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months to pay for food and medicines
After months of negotiations, the agreement was signed on May 20 but has been delayed as both sides work out the details
 On Tuesday, an Iraqi diplomat at the United Nations accused the United States of hindering the implementation
Unexpected demand increases and fears that low stocks of heating oil in both the United States and Europe might fall short of winter demand have thwarted any big sell-off despite expectations that Iraqi exports would hit the market in weeks
"I think heating oil will save the day both here and in the United States," Buglass said
