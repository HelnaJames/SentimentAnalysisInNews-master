Rangebound German shares end mixed, utilities up.
German shares were rangebound in bourse trade on Tuesday, with the highlight of the day a shifting of interest from the chemical sector into utility stocks.
The 30-share DAX ended the day down 2.50 points at 2,560.26 points after sticking in a seven-point range.
The IBIS-DAX, tracking electronic trading during the day, closed slightly better at 2,562.12 points.
The big three chemical groups took the biggest battering, while utility shares benefited from interest partly generated by Viag AG's forthcoming six month earnings report.
After the close of the electronic bourse trading Viag reported operating profit up 10 percent during the first half of this year.
