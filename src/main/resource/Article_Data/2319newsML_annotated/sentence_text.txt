The broader market was lacklustre, dealers said, and shrugged off a Bundesbank report showing slower July M3 growth, which is viewed as boosting the case for the central bank to cut the securities repurchase rate, or repo, on Thursday

Utilities have been underperforming during the last two months, but are bottoming out now, traders said
"The upswing in utilities stocks is an answer to the recent weakness of those shares", one dealer said
Dealers said the moderate M3 growth was in line with expectations and thus failed to generate momentum for the stock market
However the market will continue to look for guidance on the interest rate front ahead of the Bundesbank meeting Thursday, dealers said
The result of the FOMC meeting in the U
S
 due early in the European evening was expected to provide further clues
