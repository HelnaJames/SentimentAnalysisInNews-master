Mazda's new ad campaign sports unlikely celebrity.
Mazda is using a foreign celebrity to revamp its image in Japan, and has chosen its very own president Henry Wallace for the job.
Wallace, a famous figure in Japan as the first foreigner to head a major Japanese firm, is to star in Mazda's new advertising campaign.
The 50-year-old Wallace will appear in full-page Mazda advertisments in five major Japanese newspapers on Thursday.
"We aim to elevate our image through this ad campaign," a Mazda spokesman said on Tuesday.
Mazda broke with corporate tradition by putting a foreigner in the driving seat and is doing so again with its new sales promotion -- it is rare for a Japanese company to use photos of its top management in a campaign to sell its merchandise.
