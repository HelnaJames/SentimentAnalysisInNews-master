Icahn lifts RJR stake, repeats spin-off call
Gene RamosWASHINGTON 1996-08-22Investor Carl Icahnsaid Thursday he raised his stake in RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp
 to 5
8 percent and repeated his call for an immediate spin-off of its Nabisco Holdings Corp
 food unit
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Icahnsaid he and his companies bought 1
27 million additional shares of the tobacco and food company between Aug
 12 and 22 at prices ranging from $25
25 to $28
625 a share
That raised his stake to 15
9 million, which were purchased for a total of $489
3 million, according to the filing
He previously held about a 4
8 percent stake
Icahnsaid he and his companies bought the stock "for investment since they believe that the shares are undervalued
"He said his group thought that RJR should take all steps necessary to carry out a spin-off of RJR's non-tobacco operation to raise the value of its component parts and maximize value to shareholders
Earlier this year, Icahn, teaming up with investor Bennett LeBow, failed in an attempt to bring about a separation of the Nabisco Holdings from the tobacco business
Icahn said his group has held a meeting with RJR management at which they discussed their position about the spin-off but were told that such a move should not be undertaken now
"Registrants believe that, especially after the recent loss by another tobacco company in a smoking damage case 


 shareholders would be best served if the spinoff was accomplished immediately rather than waiting for some future date or event," the group's filing said
Icahn was apparently referring to a Florida jury verdict earlier this month against Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp
 and in favour of a smoker who sued alleging he contracted cancer because of cigarette smoking
Icahn and LeBow parted ways in June after they differed over whether the tobacco litigation settlement offered by Liggett Group Inc
, a unit of LeBow's Brooke Group Ltd
, would entice RJR shareholders to vote for a spin-off
According to a statement then issued by the two, Icahn did not believe RJR shareholders would support a tobacco litigation settlement that was not industrywide
 LeBow, meanwhile, was committed to pursuing its litigation settlements
