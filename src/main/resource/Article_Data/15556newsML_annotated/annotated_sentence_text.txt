Matsushita profit recovers strongly in April-June.
Japanese electronics giant Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd said Tuesday it has a very strong recovery in group profits in the first quarter of the 1996/97 business year.
Matsushita posted net profit of 18.5 billion yen ($172 million) on a group basis in the three months to June 30, rebounding from a huge loss of 151.3 billion yen ($1.41 billion) a year ago.
Sales in the April-June period were 1.72 trillion yen ($16.0 billion), up from 1.53 trillion yen ($14.2 billion) a year ago.
"Our business (in the first quarter of the current business year) was better than the same period a year ago both in Japan and abroad," the company said
In Japan, consumer spending and companies' capital investment were rebounding gradually, and the nation's economy was on a gradual recovery trend, although some worries over the future of the economy remained, Matsushita said.
