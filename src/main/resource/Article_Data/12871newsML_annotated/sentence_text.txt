UK: Lloyd's moves to ward off doubts on recovery
Lloyd's moves toward offdoubts on recovery
Christopher AdamsLONDON 1996-08-25Lloyd's of London tried on Sunday to ward off doubts about the success of its recovery plan, announcing that 75 percent of its investors worldwide had already accepted the proposals
The300-year-old insurance marketisembroiled in a critical legal battlein the United States where 93 investors last weekextracted an injunctionorderingLloyd's to give all U
S
 investors more information and more time to vote on the plan
Lloyd's gave its 34,000 investors -- called Names -- until Wednesday this week to decide whether to accept or reject the recovery plan, under which it hopes to reinsure billions of pounds in liabilities into a new company called Equitas
The plan includes a 3
2 billion pound ($five billion) offer tosoftenthe cost to Names of Equitasandendlitigation
Lloyd's will appeal in court in Baltimore, Maryland, on Tuesdayagainst the injunctionserved by U
S
 district judge Robert Payne in Virginia late on Friday
It was unclear how far-reaching the impact would be on the recovery plan if the appeal fails
The announcement that three-quarters of the Names had backed the plan suggested that by Wednesday there could be the overwhelming support needed to push it through
Acceptance forms were believed to be flooding into Lloyd's at the rate of 2,000 a day last week
 Four thousand more would represent nearly another 12 percent
"I am confident that, by the deadline, the offer will have been accepted by the overwhelming majority of our members," said chairman David Rowland in a brief statement on Sunday
But how much is enough to declare it unconditional?Some prominent Names contacted by Reuters noted that Lloyd's did not say how many U
S
 Names had accepted so far or which classes of Names had accepted
 A spokesman said a breakdown was not available
Before Payne's decision, Rowland was reluctant to give any information on the level of acceptances, saying such figures meant very little as success depended on "yes" votes from two key blocks: the litigating Names and those with big outstanding debts needed by Lloyd's to fund Equitas
"Lloyd's said it was interested in quality of acceptance rather than quantity," said one British Name
 "What they've got so far is anybody's guess
"He added: "If I was an American Name, why should I be in a hurry to accept?"Payne ordered Lloyd's to provide all U
S
 Names with more information by September 23
 Those who elect to wait can pay funds into an escrow account no later than September 30 and make their minds up a month later
If the offer went unconditional, Lloyd's said it might give those who had not accepted more time in which to do so
 It may not need 100 percent support by Wednesday, but a critical mass is crucial and acceptances from key parties have to be secured
