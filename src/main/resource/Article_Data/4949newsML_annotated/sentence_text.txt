"It was abig success, really,"one tradersaid
 "It'sa shamewe had this problem
Who knows would have happened otherise?"About 200 student protesters and parents blocked the main entrances to the stock exchange building, scaring off traders and bolsa officials before the opening bell
 But then about 30 or 40 riot police cleared the way to a back door, allowing personnel to enter
Electronic trading began on time but with barely any volume
 When floor trading by open outcry finally began three hours later, stock prices soared
Within minutes, the IPC index peaked at 3,432
13 points, setting a new intraday high, before gradually winding down in the afternoon
While the Mexican bolsa was shut down, the Dow Jones industrial average was tumbling into negative territory and the peso, vulnerable because of sharply lower interest rates from Tuesday's primary Mexican Treasury bill auction, started losing ground on the dollar
But the peso held firm, and market leader Telmex's ADRs charged forward, effectively coming to the bolsa's rescue, traders said
Telmex ADRs closed 3/4 higher to 34-1/8
 Telmex L shares, the largest issue on the bolsa, were up 32 centavos to 12
74 pesos ($1
70) and Telmex A shares were up 50 centavos to 12
70 pesos ($1
70)
Other Mexican ADRs weathered the bolsa shutdown and the falling Dow
Construction firm Grupo Tribasa posted big gains for the second straight day, up 3/8 to 4-3/4
 In Mexico, shares rose 5
45 percent to 17
40 pesos ($2

57 percent or 30 centavos to 3
80 pesos (51 cents)
 Situr B shares gained 7
95 percent or seven centavos to 95 centavos (13 cents)
Grupo Marti topped the list of losers by falling 4
26 percent or 10 centavos to 2
25 pesos (30 cents)
 Femsa was off 3
16 percent or 75 centavos to 23 pesos ($3
08)
"The setback (from the protest) served the market by giving investors a chance to see what the reaction (in New York) would be to the latest economic indicators and the lower interest rates," said Esteban Rojas, an analyst with the Akra brokerage firm
But once the bolsa peaked near what some considered a resistance level of 3,436 points, investors took profits, in part because of the continuing woes of the Dow
Volume was heavy at 126
28 million shares
 Of 101 stocks traded, 44 gained and 27 lost
