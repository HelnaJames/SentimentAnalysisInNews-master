Kerry says half-year profit rise 21 percent.
Kerry Group Plc, Ireland's largest food company, said Tuesday that profits jumped 21 percent in the first half of the year despite worries over so-called mad cow disease in Europe.
The company, based in Tralee in County Kerry, said pretax profits rose to 20 million punts ($32.1 million) from 16.5 million punts ($26.5 million) in the first half of 1995.
 Sales rose 1.5 percent to 589.4 million punts ($945.4 million) from 580.7 million ($931.4 million).
"While the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) scare did affect sales in some business areas at the end of the first quarter, strong advances in branded product sales in the second quarter" helped boost profits margins, Kerry said in a statement.
In March British government scientists said they had identified a new strain of the human brain disorder Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease that was most likely linked to eating beef infected with BSE, or mad cow disease.
