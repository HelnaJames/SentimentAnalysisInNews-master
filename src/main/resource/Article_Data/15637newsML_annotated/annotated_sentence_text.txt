Britain's yuppies are back on the rampage.
Crowds in London wine bars spill onto the streets, raucous laughter interrupted only by the pop of champagne corks and the roar of the latest Porsche.
British yuppies, resplendent in red braces, shoulder pads and designer suits, were almost wiped out by the economic austerity of the early 1990s.
 But they are making a comeback as the stock market hits record highs, City salaries return to six figures and property prices in London bounce back.
"Bars and restaurants are packed every night again...and the customers seem even younger and richer this time around," said the manager of a crowded bar in London's financial district.
A product of the 1980s economic boom, yuppies (young upwardly-mobile professionals) flourished under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who encouraged the nouveau riche to flaunt their wealth.
