GERMANY - German Bunds, still taking cues from the U.S. market, posted gains near the end of Tuesday's session but were off the day's highs, receding after the U.S. market retreated after key economic data.
 The September Bund future on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) was trading at 97.36, down 0.10 from Friday's settlement price.
BRITAIN - UK gilt futures ended weaker after a mainly quiet session, matching the tone on other bond markets.
The main focus will be Wednesday's auction of 2.5 billion sterling of 7.5 percent gilts due 2006, which is generally expected to be fairly well covered.
Late bond market prices.
This is how major world bond markets were trading in late European business on Tuesday.
