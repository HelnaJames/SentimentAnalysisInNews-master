The tobacco industry's troubles deepened Wednesday with the White House expected to endorse strict new regulations on cigarettes on Friday and jury deliberations about to start in a key smoking case.
The timing of the White House announcement could hardly be worse for the industry, which is still reeling from a surprise $750,000 damage award earlier this month.
Meanwhile, Michigan became the 13th state to sue the industry Wednesday, and on Thursday an Indiana jury is to start weighing whether cigarette makers can be held liable for a smoker's addiction that allegedly led to his death.
Tobacco stocks were already tumbling Wednesday on concerns about the Indiana trial when White House officials said they expected President Bill Clinton to accept the new regulations from the Food and Drug Administration on Friday
The rules were expected to be similar to those the FDA proposed about a year ago
Tobacco companies fighting more bad news.
