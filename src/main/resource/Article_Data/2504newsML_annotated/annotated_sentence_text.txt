Orem, Utah-based Novell's IntranetWare is a full-service intranet and Internet access product for businesses of all sizes.
Novell Inc. unveils intranet product.
Novell Inc. Tuesday unveiled its new IntranetWare software, intended to establish the computer networking company in the growing market for internal corporate networks known as intranets.
Novell has been a leader since 1983 in conventional networking software but has fallen behind Netscape Communications Corp. and Microsoft Corp. in the competition for intranets, private networks which function like the Internet's Web.
With IntranetWare, Novell opens our product line and (our) 55 million customers to the future of networking," said Novell Chairman Robert Frankenberg.
The company provides software for an estimated 1 million networks with 55 million users.
