MOTOR RACING-VILLENEUVE GIVES HILL MUCH TO PONDER.
Jacques Villeneuve provided compelling evidence on Saturday that he will not allow his Williams team mate Damon Hill an easy run-in to the world drivers' championship when he claimed pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix.
It was Villeneuve's second pole position in his first season in Formula One and came after many experts had predicted he would struggle to learn the long Spa-Francorchamps track quickly enough to be competitive.
The Canadian clocked a best time of one minute 50.574 seconds in his Renault-powered car just over halfway through the hour-long session and immediately before heavy rain fell.
The wet weather made the track slower and more treacherous and left Hill, who leads the title race by 17 points with four races remaining, frustrated for the final 20 minutes.
Double world champion Michael Schumacher of Germany, who is too far behind to play a part in this year's championship contest, returned to action in his Ferrari after his crash on Friday morning and clocked the third fastest time behind Hill.
