A spokesman for the American Cancer Society said it was discussing other partnerships with its skin care and nutritional products companies.
SmithKline, Cancer Society in tie-in - NYT.
Britain's SmithKline Beecham Plc will pay $1 million a year to the American Cancer Society and put the society's name on SmithKline's Nicoderm smoking-cessation patches, The New York Times reported on Tuesday.
The move is the latest marketing marriage of a drug maker and a non-profit health care association.
With the deal, SmithKline stole a march on rival Johnson &amp; Johnson, which recently introduced its own non-prescription nicotine skin patch, Nicontrol, as well as an over-the-counter version of Nicorette chewing gum to help smokers quit.
Some professional health care associations have long provided seals of approval and product commendations, but the pressure for corporate tie-ins has mounted as traditional sources of money have diminished.
