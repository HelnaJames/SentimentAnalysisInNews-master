STOCKHOLM 1996-08-20Swedish mining, metals and engineering groupTrelleborgsaid on Tuesday it expectedprofitabilitytofallin the second half of the year if currency exchange rates and metals prices remained at current levels
"Assuming currency exchange rates and metals prices now in force, which in the case of copper means a far lower level than in the past 


 we expectweaker profit generationin the second half year,"Trelleborgsaid in its first half profit statement
The group posted aprofitafter financial net of 657 million crowns ($99 million) for the first half of 1996, asharp dropfrom the 954 million crowns reported for the same 1995 period
The comparison with the first half of 1995 was rendered less flattering by a positive restructuring item of 102 million crowns taken in the second quarter of 1995
Operating incomefor the perioddippedto 10
62 billion crowns from 11
10 billion for the comparative period
This, Trelleborg said, was the result of a weaker economic scenario on its main markets
"The weaker economy, particularly on European markets, has led to weaker prices and lower volumes," it said
The mining and metals unit reported virtually unchanged sales for the period at 4
28 billion crowns, but operating profits dipped to 296 million crowns from 317 million, a fall Trelleborg said was due to the weaker economy
However, hedging had rendered the business area virtually immune to disadvantageous moves in currencies and metals prices over the period, it said
The operating profit of Trelleborg's distribution division, the second largest in the group, was more than halved to 141 million crowns
Around half of the slump was attributable to inventory losses as metals prices fell, but the unit also suffered from falling volumes and the effect of the crown appreciation on the reported sales of overseas units
