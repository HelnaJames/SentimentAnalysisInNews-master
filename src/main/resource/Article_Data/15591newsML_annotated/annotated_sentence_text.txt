ValuJet lays off 134 workers to save cash.

ValuJet Inc. said Tuesday it temporarily laid off 134 customer-service workers to conserve cash while it waits for regulatory approval to resume operations.
The company had previously recalled 500 workers, including pilots, flight attendants and customer-service agents, in hopes of returning to the skies by Aug. 23.
ValuJet, however, remains grounded while it waits for regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration
Keeping the customer service agents on the payroll while being grounded "just didn't make sense," said ValuJet spokesman Gregg Kenyon.
"We anticipate this being a short-term situation," Kenyon said
