said Tuesday it temporarilylaid off134 customer-service workersto conserve cash while it waits for regulatory approval to resume operations
The company had previouslyrecalled500 workers, including pilots, flight attendants and customer-service agents, in hopes of returning to the skies by Aug
 23
ValuJet, however, remains grounded while it waits for regulatory approval from the U
S
 Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration
Keeping the customer service agents on the payroll while being grounded "just didn't make sense," saidValuJet spokesman Gregg Kenyon
"We anticipate this being a short-term situation,"Kenyonsaid
 "We've taken steps to have these workers give us a number where they can be reached immediately when we get approval
"The airline now has about 650 to 750 workers on payroll, down from about 4,200 during normal operations, Kenyon said
ValuJet, which suspended operations in June after a crash in the Florida Everglades that killed all 110 people on board, said it expects to resume service shortly
ValuJet plans to resume service with seven aircraft and flights between Atlanta and five other U
