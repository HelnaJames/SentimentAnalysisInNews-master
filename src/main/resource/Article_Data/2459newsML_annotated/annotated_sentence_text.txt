Taiwan accidents could cost oil giant T$2 billion.

Five accidents over 10 days could cost Taiwan's Chinese Petroleum Corp more than T$2 billion (US$72.7 million) in compensation and losses, the state-owned monopoly said on Tuesday.
"Fishermen in the Kaohsiung area and residents near the oil polluted No.5 naphtha cracker have demanded about T$1.7 billion in various types of compensation," Chinese Petroleum official Huang Yaw-hao said.
"Losses in production and repair costs are close to T$300 million over these incidents."
Negotiations for compensation were under way and plaintiffs have asked for a final deal by Friday, Huang said.
