London precious metals drift, seek impetus
LONDON 1996-08-21Gold and silver shuffled in recent price ranges on Wednesday but showedpotential to try to clear tough price barriersjust ahead,dealerssaid
"(Gold) may this week re-try $388-$390 (an ounce)
 There's resistance there, but maybe not as much as people think
 We've already been there recently," adealersaid, referring to gold's failed attempt to clear the $390 level this month
Bullion closed at $387

30 from Monday's close
Dealers attributed a slight easing of the precious metals to an absence of follow-through buying after a brisk rally by silver earlier in the week
Gold had largely neglected responding in kind to silver's gains, managing only to edge up a bit
"We saw gold firm up a bit on back of the Monday rally in silver, but everyone is looking for follow-through
 There's a danger it could drift back to where it started," a dealer said
Silver ended a touch lower at $5
20 an ounce, off two cents
Several dealers said they were looking for silver to make a break to around $5
30 an ounce, perhaps as soon as this week
 But others were less enthusiastic
"The market is very slow
 Everyone's waiting for some reason to do something," a dealer said
Analysts cautioned it would run into layers of selling there after being in a downtrend for most of the year
"Silver needs help from gold now that it has broken above the $5
15 area," a dealer said
"But stock markets are doing well and any sign interest rates are staying the same or going down is good for the whites (silver, platinum and palladium) on an industrial basis
"Platinum, like silver, eased slightly to finish at $399
00 an ounce, down $0

 Its sister metal palladium closed just $0
10 lower at $125
50 after edging up from a tumble to 2-1/2 year lows earlier in the week
