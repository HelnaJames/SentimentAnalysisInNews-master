Bass/Allied agree new beer terms.
Allied Domecq Plc said on Sunday that it has agreed new beer supply terms with Bass Plc.
Allied said Bass will, if required, supply substantially more than half of Allied Domecq Retailing's requirements, including Tetley Bitter, in 1998 and 1999, at pre-agreed levels of discount
Existing beer supply agreements between Carlsberg-Tetley and Allied Domecq Retailing will continue on their current basis until December 12 1997, Allied said
After that, ADR will be free to buy its beer from any supplier at commercial rates.
Allied said 63 million stg of the proceeds from the sale of its stake in Carlsberg-Tetley to Bass will be used in the  
balance sheet as a provision for uneconomic beer supply.
