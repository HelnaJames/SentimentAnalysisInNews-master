A battle is brewing in Connecticut over who is going to foot the bill for all the electricity Northeast Utilities was forced to buy this summer to make up for the loss of its nuclear power plants.
At stake is $120 million, which the state's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, vows must not be paid by consumers.
"We will not permit and strongly oppose the costs to be borne by any NU customers," said Blumenthal, adding that the problems plaguing the utility's nuclear operations stemmed from "extraordinary mismanagement."
At the centre of the controversy are NU's two Connecticut nuclear facilities: Millstone and Connecticut Yankee.
The plants, with a combined generating capacity of about 3,282 megawatts, or about half of the state's power demand, were shut in March and July, respectively, amid safety concerns raised by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Conn., Northeast Utilities face off over power costs.
