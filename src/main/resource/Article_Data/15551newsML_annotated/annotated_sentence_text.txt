Fidelity names two to head investment strategy.
Fidelity Investments portfolio managers Richard Habermann and Jonathan Weed on Tuesday were named joint chief investment strategists for Portfolio Advisory Services
The two men succeed Robert Beckwitt, who is leaving Fidelity to join Goldman Sachs, effective Sept. 1.
For a minimum investment of $200,000, the advisory services unit provides investors with tailored investment management for a diversified portfolio of Fidelity mutual funds, the nation's largest mutual fund company said.
Habermann heads the newly formed Asset Allocation Group, which in addition to Weed, also includes George Vanderheiden, manager of the Destiny and Fidelity Advisor Growth Opportunities funds.
Before taking over as lead manager of Fidelity's Asset Manager funds, Habermann was division head for international equity funds and was involved with these funds' asset allocation strategies.
