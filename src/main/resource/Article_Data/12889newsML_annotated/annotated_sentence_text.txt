Whitbread says Bass referral likely.
Whitbread said on Sunday that the purchase by Bass of Carlsberg-Tetley would probably have to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC).
"It would seem likely that this deal will have to be referred to the MMC based purely on the size of the new company and its market share to ensure a fair and competitive enivronment," said Whitbread in a statement.
The brewer said it had taken a good look at Carlsberg-Tetley and saw brand conflicts which would have diminshed the value of the deal for it. 
Whitbread added there may be benefits for it if brands were released as part of the conditions for allowing the Bass purchase to go through, and expected sales opportunities "in the confusion which always exists in the aftermath of a merger".
