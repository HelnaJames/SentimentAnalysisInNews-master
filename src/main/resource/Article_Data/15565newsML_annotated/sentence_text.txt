London precious metals firmer but cautious after holiday
LONDON 1996-08-27Precious metals priceshadturned higheron Tuesday when London-based dealers returned after their late summer holiday weekend
But they were cautious about whether or not the new levels would last now that the market was back to full strength
"Moves made when part of the market is on holidaytend to give up theghostpretty quickly,"one dealersaid

45 late close in New York on Monday largely held during the Asian trading day although markets in both time zones were quiet
"The Australians were doing some buy-backs (of gold sold previously) in New York but they were sellers again this morning in Tokyo," a dealer said
The market's reaction to the expiry of the current over-the-counter (OTC) options on Wednesday would be key to gold's short-term direction, dealers said
Options give their owner the right but not the obligation to buy a commodity at a fixed price, called the strike price, at a given time, known as the expiry date
Current gold and silver prices suggested the $390
00 and $5
30 strike price respectively could be the targets come the expiry at 1330 GMT, dealers said
There were mixed views on the how capable the markets were of building on their new price levels
"Gold does not look overbought
 It has had an orderly move and has built a good foundation but I would be cautious about silver at these numbers," a dealer said
"When people start talking about prices in the $5
30s and $5
50s, they tend not to happen," he added
Technical analysts, who chart previous prices to predict future trends, were more positive
"Silver's rounding base is completing now
 There is resistance at 530 cents but the aim seems to be 540 cents where the downtrend comes in," said Elli Gifford at Investment Research of Cambridge
Silver was quoted at $5
28, up five cents
Platinum and palladium were also mildly firmer -- platinum fixed at $401
00, its highest since August 9 -- and palladium's fixing of $125
50 was a couple of dollars above its 2-1/2 year low struck last week
