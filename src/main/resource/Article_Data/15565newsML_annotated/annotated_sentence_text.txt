London precious metals firmer but cautious after holiday.
Precious metals prices had turned higher on Tuesday when London-based dealers returned after their late summer holiday weekend.
But they were cautious about whether or not the new levels would last now that the market was back to full strength.
"Moves made when part of the market is on holiday tend to give up the ghost pretty quickly," one dealer said.
Gold fixed at $389.00 per ounce, its highest since August 5 and compared with $387.50 on Friday.
Bullion's $389.45 late close in New York on Monday largely held during the Asian trading day although markets in both time zones were quiet.
