32 billion marks ($886

The diversified group said itspre-tax profitslumpedto 1
178 billion marks in the first six months of 1996, butchairman Georg Obermeierstressed that thecomparative 1995 figurewas swollen by one-off gains from selling off units
Speaking to a news conference, Obermeier saidoperating profithad risen10 percent in the six-month period, but declined to give absolute figures
He also noted that the bulk of Viag's first-half profit in 1995 was the result of one-off gains from the sale of its 43
4 percent stake in Germany's biggest paper maker PWA and the final consolidaton of its SKW Trostberg unit
"Overall theViag groupisdeveloping in line with 


 expectations
 The economic weakness of the winter period had an effect on the cyclical divisions, however growth tendencies are evident again in several areas," Viag said
Viag also said its group sales expanded by two percent to 21
803 billion marks from 21
375 billion in the first half of 1996
The group said sales growth was varied across different divisions, with strong gains in its energy units, in its SKW unit's natural fibres division, drinks packaging at its Schmalbach-Lubeca unit and at Computer 2000
However turnover in aluminium business at its VAW unit and steel trading at its Kloeckner unit had come under strong pressure, Viag said
Overall packaging sales dropped to 5
9 billion marks from 6
3 billion marks, while the other core business segments -- energy, chemicals and logistics -- posted sales growth
Viag said it would continue to expand its core business areas and proceed with a range of restructuring and cost-cutting measures
Group investment in fixed assets dropped to 792 million marks from 913 million marks in the first half of 1996 while group spending on participations dropped dramatically to 178 million marks from 1
49 billion
In the first half of 1995, Viag and its units bought several major companies including SBI Systems Bio-Industries, bought by Viag's chemicals division and a majority stake in Computer 2000
Viag's workforce was little changed at 82,874 compared with 84,939 in the first six months of 1995
