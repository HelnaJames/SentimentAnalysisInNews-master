Recreational vehicleshaul upHonda profits
Mitsuo SuzukiTOKYO 1996-08-23Honda Motor Co Ltdannounced on Friday that itsfirst-quarter profitsjumpedby nearly 300 percent from a year earlier thanks to booming demand for recreational vehicles and a weaker yen
The increase prompted the automaker to raise its profit forecasts for the current business year
Honda's group net profit in the first quarter of the business year that started on April 1 jumped 283
4 percent from a year before to 45
71 billion yen ($423 million)
"The main reason for the profit increase was strong demand for recreational vehicles," managing director Kunihiro Chujo told Reuters
He also said group profits in the first quarter were pushed up by 25 billion yen ($231 million) due to the weaker yen, which averaged 107 yen to the dollar compared with 84
45 yen to the dollar a year earlier
Booming sales of recreational vehicles boosted operating profits by 50
6 billion yen ($468 million), the company said
But Chujo said the robust sales also increased sales costs by 37
1 billion yen ($343 million) in the quarter
Honda sold almost three times the number of CR-V recreational vehicles in Japan -- 26,492 -- it had targeted
Other recreational vehicles, such Step Wagons and Odysseys, exceeded their sales targets by 100 to almost 200 percent
Encouraged by the quarterly result, Honda raised its parent and group profit forecasts for the 1996/97 business year
It raised its forecast for group net profit to 160 billion yen ($1
48 billion) from its May forecast of 120 billion yen ($1
11 billion)
In 1995/96, Honda posted actual parent current profit of 47
18 billion yen ($436 million) and group net profit of 70
8 billion yen ($655 million)
Honda also announced that domestic production in July was up 18
5 percent from the same month a year ago while domestic sales were up 22
5 percent
It said in a statement said that its exports in July rose 14
7 percent year-on-year, and its overseas production was up 30
1 percent
"Its production is exceeding projected levels, its U
S
 sales are strong now and it will start exporting its CR-V to the U
S
 That will contribute to its profit in the second half," Nomura Research analyst Seiji Sugiura said
"Domestic demand for Honda cars has been so strong that I believe group profits could be larger than the already revised-up figure of 160 billion yen ($1
48 billion) this year," Sugiura said
Honda will start selling CR-Vs in the United States early next year and will resume exporting four-door Civics there later this year, another Honda official said
He said the Civic exports are needed because Honda's Ohio plant is operating at full capacity and cannot meet demand
Honda's sales in North America rose 14
6 percent from a year earlier to 457,912 in the January-July period due to strong demand for almost all its models, including U
S
-made Civics and the Japan-produced Acura TL luxury car
Overall North American automobile demand rose 3
9 percent to 8
41 million units in the same period
