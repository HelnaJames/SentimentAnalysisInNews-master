Birt vows to safeguard BBC World Service
Keith WeirEDINBURGH 1996-08-23BBC Director General John Birt vowed on Friday to safeguard the corporation's much-praised World Service
Birt's plans for closer integration of radio's World Service with domestic programme production havesparked fearsthat thequality and breadth of its news coveragewillsuffer
But he told the Edinburgh International Television Festival that the World Service was safe in his hands
"We will continue to fight for and to safeguard the quality, distinctiveness and independence of the World Service and all our global journalism," he said in a speech
"And it is extraordinary that anyone should suggest otherwise," he added
With their distinctive opening theme tune, Lillibulero, World Service news broadcasts have won respect around the world for their even-handed treatment of global issues
Birt's reforms, part of a broader reorganisation at the BBC, have provoked howls of anguish both in Britain and among the World Service's estimated 140 million listeners worldwide
More than 200 parliamentarians have signed a motion of protest over the changes at the World Service
 Flowers have been left as a sign of mourning at World Service's Bush House headquarters in central London
Birt said the BBC's independent reporting had brought it into conflict with a number of governments around the world
He said China and Saudi Arabia had effectively forced it to end transmission of its satellite television news services while he added that Burma continued to jam the World Service
But Birt said the BBC would not bow to political pressure
"We will outlast the world's totalitarian regimes
 We will remain a beacon in an uncertain world," he said
