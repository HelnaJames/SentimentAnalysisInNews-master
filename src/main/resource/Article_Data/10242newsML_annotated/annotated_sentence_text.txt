Birt's plans for closer integration of radio's World Service with domestic programme production have sparked fears that the quality and breadth of its news coverage will suffer.
But he told the Edinburgh International Television Festival that the World Service was safe in his hands.
"We will continue to fight for and to safeguard the quality, distinctiveness and independence of the World Service and all our global journalism," he said in a speech.
"And it is extraordinary that anyone should suggest otherwise," he added.
Birt vows to safeguard BBC World Service.
BBC Director General John Birt vowed on Friday to safeguard the corporation's much-praised World Service.
