No connection was found between cow's milk and the 18 cases of B-cell autoimmunity that were uncovered, study author Jill Norris said.
Cow's milk not linked to childhood diabetes-report.
Fears that giving cow's milk to infants increases the risk of the child developing diabetes are probably unfounded, a study published on Tuesday said.
Researchers at the University of Colorado at Denver found babies under the age of three months who consumed proteins found in cow's milk were not more likely to develop a type of autoimmune disorder that is an early predictor of diabetes.
The authors of the study, which was published in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association, said it disputed previous reports that showed a 60 percent increased risk of diabetes from cow's milk.
The Colorado researchers screened 253 children from 171 families identified to be at risk for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
