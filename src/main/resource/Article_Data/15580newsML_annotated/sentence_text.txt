CHICAGO 1996-08-27Fears that giving cow's milk to infants increases the risk of the child developing diabetes are probably unfounded, astudy published on Tuesdaysaid
Researchers at the University of Colorado at Denver found babies under the age of three months who consumed proteins found in cow's milk were not more likely to develop a type of autoimmune disorder that is an early predictor of diabetes
Theauthors of the study, which was published in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association, said itdisputedprevious reportsthat showed a 60 percent increased risk of diabetes from cow's milk
The Colorado researchers screened 253 children from 171 families identified to be at risk for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
No connection was found between cow's milk and the 18 cases of B-cell autoimmunity that were uncovered,study author Jill Norrissaid

"Cow's milk has many valuable nutrients and forms a critical part of the diet of many infants and children throughout the world
 Thus, feeding practices that exclude cow's milk should not be adopted without a strong scientific indication
 In our opinion, such an opionion has not been clearly established," they wrote
