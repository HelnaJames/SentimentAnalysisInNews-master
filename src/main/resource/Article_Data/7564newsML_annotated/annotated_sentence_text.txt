London precious metals drift in pre-holiday lull.
Gold drifted in sleepy trading on Thursday and was likely to remain listless ahead of a holiday weekend in Britain and Hong Kong, dealers said.
Precious metals, led by silver, made a half-hearted attempt to push higher late in the afternoon but quickly reverted to previous price levels.
Gold bullion closed at $386.95 an ounce in London, compared with $387.25 on Wednesday
 Little change was expected until after the holidays on Monday, dealers said.
The market shrugged off news that the German Bundesbank had cut its key money market interest rate much more than expected.
