Back-to-school spending is up.
Shoppers are loading up this year on perennial back-to-school favourites such as jeans, shirts and sneakers, with parents spending an average of 12 percent more for clothing and other supplies.
"It's sort of funny because it really hasn't changed a lot from years ago, with jeans, shirts and pants and things like that being the basics of what people are looking for," said Andrea Kent, director of the Retail Marketing Group for American Express Travel Related Services Inc.
The spending increase was caused by an emphasis on brand-name goods that typically cost more, lower retailer inventories which reduce the amount of discounted, sale merchandise, and higher consumer confidence, American Express said.
Overall, back-to-school spending will rise a projected 12 percent to an average of $363 per child, American Express said in its second annual survey of 1,000 shoppers.
