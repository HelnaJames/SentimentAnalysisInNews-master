Sayansk Aluminium chief executive Oleg Deripaska said on Friday 1996 primary aluminium output would be 327,000 tonnes.
Another senior official said the plant was working at 100 percent capacity and would continue to do so.
The company plans to increase aluminium output in the near future to 600,000 tonnes a year, a company statement said but did not give any exact timeframe.
Deripaska said the entire programme would cost $68 million for smelters and $48 million for additional plant upgrades, which company officials say they expect to finance with a combination of private investor, commercial bank and World Bank investments or credits.
