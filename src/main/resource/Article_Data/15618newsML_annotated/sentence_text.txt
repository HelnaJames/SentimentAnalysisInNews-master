"Some foreign investors have been put offby Malaysia's burgeoning current account deficit, which surged from 11 billion ringgit in 1994 to 17
8 billion ringgit in 1995 and is expected by the government to stabilise at around 17 billion this year
But viewing the trade balance performance for the first six months of 1996,economistssaid it appeared thecurrent account deficitmay shrinkeven below the 14 billion ringgit level projected by private economists for this year

June's trade improvements were led by exports of 16
3 billion ringgit against imports of 15
7 billion ringgit
Year-on-year, imports fell a stunning 11
5 percent in June, the sharpest decline in about 10 years
 The drop was in part amplified by a high base in June 1995, economists said
Exports rose about 4
4 percent in June 1996 from June 1995
Economists said the sharp drop in imports was likely linked to a worldwide slump in the electronics industry, a slower pace of Malaysian infrastructure imports and an easing in consumer spending amid tight domestic monetary policies
The electronics industry in Malaysia uses a high proportion of imported parts, and electronics represents the largest export earner for the country, at 18
8 percent of total export earnings
"The real surprise was the 11 percent import decline in June," said Ng Bok Eng, a regional economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell
He said that if the trend continued, the full-year trade deficit may be well below official forecasts of 7
1 billion ringgit against the 9
2 billion ringgit gap in 1995
Malaysian officials have predicted a strengthening of the country's balance of payments this year amid more prudent budgetary and tight monetary policies, encouragement of savings and improvements in its export sector
In the first six months of 1996, Malaysia registered a trade deficit of 798
4 million ringgit, a sharp improvement over the 5
6 billion ringgit deficit in the same period in 1995
Faster growth in exports of 12
6 percent over the six months versus a 6
6 percent increase in imports accounted for the improvement, the department said
