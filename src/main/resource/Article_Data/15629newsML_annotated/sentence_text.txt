UK: UK pension funds prefer balanced management - poll
UK pension funds prefer balanced management - poll
LONDON 1996-08-27The top UK pension funds still prefer a balanced style of fund management but there are more specialist mandates being awarded, a survey of UK pension funds by Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management (PDFM) shows
The survey, conducted earlier this year, polled 200 funds of over 100 million stg and 18 funds of under 200 million stg
Most of them were UK-owned corporate schemes but others were local authority-owned or foreign-owned corporate funds
The survey showedbalanced management, where the manager is responsible for a wide range of asset classes and does both asset allocation and stockpicking,remains popular
"Theproportion of funds regarding this as their principal form of investment managementremainsremarkably steady," areport with the PDFM surveysaid
But large funds (over 500 million stg) which have had their own investment management teams in-house are using specialist managers more -- 30 percent of respondents against 18 percent two years ago
 The poll has been done for seven years
Balanced management is also preferred (70 percent) for the largest proportion of funds under management
There has been a trend for medium-sized funds (200-500 million stg) to use two balanced managers, down from the three managers customary three years ago
 Smaller funds have reduced from two managers to one
The benchmarks for asset allocation are also shifting away from CAPS or WM towards customised benchmarks which PDFM found "surprising"
 "We


would withhold judgement until at least next year," the report with the survey said
Last year 11 percent said they expected to change their benchmark during this year and in fact 11 percent did
 A similar 11 percent are expecting to change again in the next year
The poll showed balanced fund managers' performance is commonly judged by survey medians, although some use survey-weighted averages
 By far the most popular outperformance target remains one percent or upper quartile
But specialist managers' targets tend to be higher -- upper quartile or index plus 2
0 percent or 1
0 percent
"This is explained by the declining popularity of the so-called "aggressive" managers, particularly for UK equity portfolios, the use of which has halved to 22 percent from 1993," PDFM said
The survey also shows that funds are "churning" managers more -- with 24 percent of respondents parting company with their managers in 1996, up from 18 percent the year before
There has been a sharp fall in the use of traded options on individual equities by the funds but a strong rise in the use of hedging, which has more than doubled since 1993
More UK pension funds are using global custodians -- 20 percent from 17 percent last year and 16 percent are to actively consider their custodian arrangements during 1996
