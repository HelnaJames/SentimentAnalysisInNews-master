The survey showed balanced management, where the manager is responsible for a wide range of asset classes and does both asset allocation and stockpicking, remains popular.
"The proportion of funds regarding this as their principal form of investment management remains remarkably steady," a report with the PDFM survey said.
UK pension funds prefer balanced management - poll.
The top UK pension funds still prefer a balanced style of fund management but there are more specialist mandates being awarded, a survey of UK pension funds by Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management (PDFM) shows.
The survey, conducted earlier this year, polled 200 funds of over 100 million stg and 18 funds of under 200 million stg.
 Most of them were UK-owned corporate schemes but others were local authority-owned or foreign-owned corporate funds.
