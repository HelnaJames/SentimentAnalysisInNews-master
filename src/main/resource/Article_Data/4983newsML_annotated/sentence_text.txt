"Barring a few incidents of throwing stones at transport vehicles,the situationwasnormal,"Gopendra Bahadur Pandey, spokesman for the Home (Interior) Ministry, said
The strike was called by the National Mass Movement Coordination Committee (NMMCC) inprotest againstthe ruling centre-right coalitionsaying it was responsible forcorruption, high inflation and unemploymentin the Himalayan kingdom
"The strikepassed off peacefully and in an impressive way," aspokespersonof the communist-led who called the strike, said
This is the first majorpolitical protest againstPrime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's Nepali Congress-led coalition
Goverment officials said the strike had a "minor impact" in the city while eye witnesses said most shops in the main shopping area remained closed
 Only a few transport vehicles were running
The communists also criticised Deuba's government for signing in February a treaty with neighbouring India to share waters of the Mahakali river, which they say was not fair to Nepal
The treaty now awaits a ratification by the Nepali parliament
The strikers have also accused the government of harassing innocent people and political rivals in western Nepal under the guise of a crackdown on Maoist rebels in an insurgency which has claimed more than 40 lives in the past six months
The strike, which came a day after the end of a three-month closure by textile mills opposing a rise in sales tax, was the first major showdown with the opposition since the government came to power last September
The Deuba's coalition assumed power after it dislodged in a confidence vote a communist minority government which had ruled for nine months
Nepal launched a multi-party democracy under a constitutional monarchy headed by King Birendra in 1990 after bloody pro-democracy demonstrations
