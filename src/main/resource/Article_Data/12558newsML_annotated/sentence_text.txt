Jackson visited the city, Morocco's financial centre, on his return from South Africa last month and said he wanted to perform there because it reminded him of the Hollywood movie Casablanca

A live televised broadcast of Jackson's show to the United States had also been planned by the Moroccan organisers, the television added
The interior ministry has in the past banned other big concerts, including one by the popular Casablanca-based satirist Ahmed Sanoussi, without explanation
