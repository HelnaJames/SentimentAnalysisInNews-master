FINNISH H1 HOTEL, RESTAURANT SALES UP 2.1 PCT YR/YR.
The value of sales of the Finnish hotel and restaurant branch increased 2.1 percent year-on-year in January-June, the Hotel and Restaurant Council said in a statement on Tuesday.
The volume of sales rose 0.9 percent, it said.
"June does not seem to have brought any change to the weak development of restaurant sales in the early months this year," the council said.
"The hotel accommodation sales trend, which has been quite satisfactory in the earlier months of the year, was clearly below expectations in June," it said.
The value of restaurant sales rose 1.2 percent year-on-year in June and 1.3 percent in the first six months of the year compared to the corresponding period in 1995.
