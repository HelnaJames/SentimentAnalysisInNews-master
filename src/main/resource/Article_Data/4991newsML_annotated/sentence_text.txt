Rostislav KhotinKIEV 1996-08-21Ukraine tried tosootheChina's angeron Wednesday over a visit by Taiwanese Vice-President Lien Chan and re-affirmed Kiev's commitment to a "one China" policy
"We in Kiev regard Taiwan as an integral part of China
 Nothing should damage our relations with China," Foreign MinisterHennady Udovenkotold reporters
"We think the private trip of the Taiwanese representative on a private invitation should not be enough to worsen Ukrainian-Chinese relations
"China has already reacted to the visit byscrappinga planned trip to Kievby a delegation headed by Li Tieying, chairman of the State Commission for Economic Restructuring
The visitors had been due to arrive on Wednesday for five days and hold meetings with President Leonid Kuchma and Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko
Officials in Kiev, which regards China as one of its most important political and economic partners, were clearly upset over the row
 Udovenko said the postponement of the visit was a "temporary decision"
Lien left Ukraine on Wednesday afternoon after a three-day visit at the invitation of the chancellor of Kiev State University, which granted him an honorary degree
 He also visited Ukraine's separatist pro-Russia Crimean peninsula
A Chinese spokesman in Beijing said Lien's trip to Ukraine to accept a degree had been made with political motives
 China's ambassador to Ukraine protested to the Foreign Ministry and announced the cancellation of Li Tieying's visit
Taiwan State Radio said Lien had met Ukraine's president on Wednesday
 Kiev denied the report
"There was no meeting
 Neither official, nor private nor non-official
 I officially deny that information," a spokesman for Kuchma said
 "There is no point at all for the president to meet him
 The Chinese are even angry over his private stay in Ukraine
"Officials blamed a lack of coordination between governmental bodies
 Ukraine had denied Lien's presence in the country immediately after the first media reports that he was here
"We are innocent, and this is all so stupid
 When we were saying that he was not here -- well, much to our surprise, he was," a top Ukrainian diplomat told Reuters
 "We made fools of ourselves by allowing the world to see this mess
"China regards Nationalist-ruled Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to isolate the island diplomatically since a civil war separated them in 1949
China is Ukraine's second largest economic partner after Russia with annual bilateral trade totalling almost $1 billion
 Kiev has no diplomatic or official ties with Taiwan
A Chinese spokesman said on Tuesday Ukraine's acceptance of Lien's visit had constituted a grave violation of its commitment on the question of Taiwan in a 1994 communique which established diplomatic ties between China and Ukraine
