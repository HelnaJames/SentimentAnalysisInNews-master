UK dismisses report former royal estates for sale
LONDON 1996-08-25The British Treasury on Sunday described as pure speculation" a report saying the government was planning a huge stock market flotation of the Crown Estate, the property which once belonged to the British monarch
TheSunday Business newspapersaid Britain's Queen Elizabeth would receive one billion pounds ($1
5 billion) as part of the six billion pound ($14 billion) deal
The fate of the Crown Estate has been under discussion since it was announced last week that the Queen was studying plans for a radical shake-up ofmonarchy, which isreeling from a series of messy scandals and divorces
The Crown Estate, which includes land across the British countryside as well as lucrative areas in London, was surrendered to the government by George 111 in 1760 in exchange for a fixed annual income
There has been speculation that the monarchy would get these estates back in return for renouncing the state subsidies which are now provided to cover expenses
Sunday Business said the Treasury had confirmed that the Crown Estate was a candidate for privatisation, but a spokesman for the Treasury denied such confirmation had been given
The newspaper said the Queen would receive a one-off fee of 10 times the current income she receives from the Estate which amounted to 94
6 million pounds ($147 million) last year
The Queen, her son Prince Charles and other members of the royal family have formed a committee to look at ways of updating and improving the monarchy
Their review not only covers finances but is also looking at scrapping ancient laws which discriminate against women in the succession to the monarchy and which also ban the monarch from marrying a Roman Catholic
