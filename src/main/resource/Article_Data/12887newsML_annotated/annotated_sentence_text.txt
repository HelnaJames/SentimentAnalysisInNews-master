UK dismisses report former royal estates for sale.
The British Treasury on Sunday described as pure speculation" a report saying the government was planning a huge stock market flotation of the Crown Estate, the property which once belonged to the British monarch.
The Sunday Business newspaper said Britain's Queen Elizabeth would receive one billion pounds ($1.5 billion) as part of the six billion pound ($14 billion) deal.
The fate of the Crown Estate has been under discussion since it was announced last week that the Queen was studying plans for a radical shake-up of monarchy, which is reeling from a series of messy scandals and divorces.
The Crown Estate, which includes land across the British countryside as well as lucrative areas in London, was surrendered to the government by George 111 in 1760 in exchange for a fixed annual income.
There has been speculation that the monarchy would get these estates back in return for renouncing the state subsidies which are now provided to cover expenses
