Zimbabwe public servants call off strike
Emelia SitholeHARARE 1996-08-21Zimbabwean civil servants on Wednesday called off a strike that partiallyparalysedsomecritical essential services, thestate news agency ZIANAsaid
The agency quoted Palmer Chinosengwa, an executive member of the Public Service Association (PSA) union, as saying the strike over pay was suspended following an agreement by the government to discuss their grievances
The civil servants haddefiedagovernment orderto return to work by Wednesday morning, with their leaders saying they would only do so if the government committed to addressing the workers' complaints
Chinosengwa urged all strikers to return to work on Thursday, but added theymight walk out againifnegotiationswith the government scheduled for Thursday provedunsatisfactory
"The strikeachieved somethingbecause we managed to force government to come to a roundtable and look critically at our grievances,"Chinosengwasaid
PSA officials were unavailable for an independent confirmation of the report
 However, state radio said two PSA leaders arrested by secret police earlier in the day had been freed
Police spokesman Dave Njagu said the two, PSA executive secretary John Makoni and his assistant Charles Chiviru, were arrested while organising civil servants for a protest march at a government building
"The two men were picked up for forcing people to join the strike and the police are now looking into the charges," Njagu said
The PSA called the strike -- which started on Tuesday and is a rare action by  civil servants -- to press demands for wage rises of around 30 percent and said increases of between three to eight percent recently awarded by the government were unacceptable
Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro declared the strike illegal, saying those who did not return to work by Wednesday would be sacked
