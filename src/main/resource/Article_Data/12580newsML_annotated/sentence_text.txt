The beer can was shredded by the explosion, and by the powder residue we know it was a fuse device, not a pipe bomb
Several beer cans and water bottles inside the receptacle helped absorb the explosion
 It was like an M-80 or M-100 (firecacker) or slightly larger
"We have a description of two males and are looking for them now
 It is possible that we have photographs or video that will help the search
"There were already over 100 members of security forces, both uniformed and plainclothes, at the club, and security was increased for the remainder of the third round and for Sunday's final round
It was believed to be the first such incident at a golf tournament
 The Akron competition is a $2
