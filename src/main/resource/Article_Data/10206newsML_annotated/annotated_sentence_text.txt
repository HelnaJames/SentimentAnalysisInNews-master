Zimbabwe civil servants press ahead with strike.
Zimbabwean civil servants pressed on with a strike for higher pay on Friday in an unprecedented defiance of government threats to sack them if they persisted.
Thousands including junior state doctors, nurses, magistrates and mortuary attendants, emboldened by strong public support, said they would remain on the streets until their demands for wage rises of between 30 and 60 percent were met.
The strike is a rare challenge to President Robert Mugabe and his dominant ruling ZANU-PF party, both in power since 1980.
Some senior officials and MPs have broken ranks with the government to support the workers.
Others have insisted that the government could not afford to back down.
