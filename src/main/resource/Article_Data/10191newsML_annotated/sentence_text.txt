Malcolm DavidsonLONDON 1996-08-23London sharespowered to a new peakon Friday before unexpectedly strong U
S
 economic data sent U
S
 and European stocks into retreat
Surprisingly strong U
S
 durable goods figures weighed heavily on Wall Street at the opening and pushed U
S
 Treasury bonds down as well
Wall Street's strong overnight performance had been a major influence on London shares, along with hopes that an interest rate cut by the German Bundesbank on Thursday could pave the way for British rates to be shaved again, too
London's blue-chip FTSE 100 index rose to a record of 3,911 points but later drifted back to around the key 3,900 level
German and French shares were mixed, while the dollar continued to lose ground after a push higher sparked by the German rate cut fizzled out
The dollar's fall below 1
49 marks in Europe followed fresh assessments of the likely direction of interest rates following the Bundesbank's move
"The sentiment is that this will be the last German cut, which has left a bit of a vacuum today as people decide which way to position themselves," one German bank dealer said
Late in European trading, the dollar was stuck in a tight range at 1
4875 marks and 108
53 yen, compared with 1

With a long weekend coming up in Britain, dealers said the equity market remained cautious despite the FTSE breaching a psychological level at 3,900 points
"Prices were marked back on the (U
S
) durable goods figures but there isn't any selling
 I still think there are short positions out there
 People are trying to square away their books before the long weekend," one senior trader said
Wall Street opened soft, pressured by Treasuries, but by 1400 GMT the Dow Jones index had recovered much of its early loss to trade around three points down
London dealers said they expected the market to consolidate its recent gains although the underlying tone remained firm, backed by encouraging corporate earnings and an improved interest rate environment
French shares extended their losses after the U
S
 data but climbed back after hitting resistance at around 2,009 on the CAC-40 share index and had just pushed into positive territory by 1400 GMT
Paris stocks were hurt earlier on by profit-taking following big gains on Thursday
