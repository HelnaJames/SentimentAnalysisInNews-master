Philippines wary of terrorist threats to APEC meet.
The Philippines' top military officer said on Tuesday Manila was exchanging intelligence information with the United States and other countries on potential terrorist threats to the APEC summit later this year.
"Certainly those countries going to APEC must exchange information and talk of possible security problems," Philippine armed forces chief General Arturo Enrile said in an interview at the end of a three-day visit to Singapore.
Manila is taking elaborate security precautions for the summit of leaders of the 18 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum when it is held in the Philippines this November
U.S. President Bill Clinton is expected to attend.
Enrile said among particular concerns were Islamic militant groups such as Hamas.
