A weak survey of Japanese business sentiment boosted the dollar on Wednesday and European bourses were mixed, with London and Frankfurt up, helped by a firm Wall Street, but Paris down on currency and strike worries.
At 1100 GMT the dollar was trading at around 108.38 yen, up from its European close on Tuesday of 107.55 after the Bank of Japan's quarterly corporate survey, or "tankan", showed the diffusion index for major manufacturers -- an important gauge of business sentiment -- falling to minus seven in August from minus three in the previous survey in May.
The unexpected figures convinced markets that Japanese interest rates would stay at rock-bottom levels -- weakening the yen
 The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent.
