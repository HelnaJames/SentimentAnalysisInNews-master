Closing stock market indices.
Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Tuesday.
LONDON - Losses in British bank and oil shares, plus weakness in gilts, kept a lid on the FTSE 100, but the leading blue chip index managed to hold the closely-watched 3,900 level, closing 1.8 points lower at 3,905.7.
FRANKFURT - German equities slightly higher after a listless session, during which the DAX traded in a range of less than ten points.
 Sentiment muted by ongoing weakness of the dollar and a lower close on Wall Street overnight, but trade underpinned by stronger German debt market.
The 30-share DAX index closed at 2,558.84, up 6.48 points.
