Polish shares extend rally, may lose steam.
Polish shares rose for the fourth day running in higher turnover on Tuesday but analysts were uncertain whether slightly better July company earnings would help sustain the rally.
They said the day's session offered mixed signals as stronger selling after price fixing indicated a fall but higher turnover showed new investors joined the fray.
"A fall seems more likely tomorrow but a rise is also possible because high turnover after price fixing showed there are new players," said Pawel Tarnowski, an analyst at Raiffeisen Capital &amp; Investment.
The main market's all-share WIG index rose 1.6 percent to 13,183.8 points and turnover rose 22 percent to 132 million zlotys ($48.2 million) on both markets.
Gainers led losers by 43 to 23 with 11 stocks stable.
