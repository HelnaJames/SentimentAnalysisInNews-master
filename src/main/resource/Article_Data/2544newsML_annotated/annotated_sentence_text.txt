POLISH JULY EARNINGS JUST UP AFTER WEAK FIRST HALF.
Firms listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange recorded slightly better July earnings after a weak first half, but analysts said it was too early to tell if there would be an earnings rebound this year.
In July 48 firms on the main and parallel markets showed a real net profit growth year-on-year compared with 34 firms over the first six months.
"July earnings were average, but better than the weak results recorded in May and June, so they're returning to normal rather than worsening," said Pawel Tarnowski, an analyst at Raiffeisen Capital and Investment.
Analysts had attributed this year's long winter to lower profits over the year's first four months.
But they said unspectacular May and June earnings hastened a downward correction that followed the main market's 90- percent rise this year to a 27-month high of 14,282.2 points on July 5.
