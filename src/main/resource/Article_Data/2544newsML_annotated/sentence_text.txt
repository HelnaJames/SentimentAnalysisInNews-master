Steven SilberWARSAW 1996-08-20Firms listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange recordedslightly betterJuly earningsafter aweak first half, butanalystssaid it was too early to tell if there would be an earnings rebound this year
In July 48 firms on the main and parallel markets showed a real net profit growth year-on-year compared with 34 firms over the first six months
"July earningswereaverage, butbetterthan theweak resultsrecorded in May and June, so they're returning to normal rather than worsening," saidPawel Tarnowski, an analyst at Raiffeisen Capital and Investment

Analysts had expected one more growth spurt but instead a 14-percent downtrend and then stability followed until last week when investors started buying in hopes of better earnings
But analysts said many players, especially foreign investors, would need preliminary third-quarter results due in October to be sure profits had taken a bullish turn
Jacek Dzierwa, Polish equity analyst at Salomon Brothers in London, said better July earnings were a good sign but nothing definite, as Polish auditors were likely to find losses previously overlooked
"I'm taking those monthly results as an indication, but nothing tangible," Dzierwa said
Firms showing good results tended to rise on the bourse on Tuesday, such as top gainer PPABank , up by the daily maximum 10 percent
But analysts said the July results were not likely strong enough to maintain the WIG's recent four-session, six-percent jump to Tuesday's close at 13,183
