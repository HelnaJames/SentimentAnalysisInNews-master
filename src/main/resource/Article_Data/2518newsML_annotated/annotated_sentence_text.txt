Decision nears on Indiana tobacco suit.

Another liability challenge to the tobacco industry headed toward a decision in court Tuesday, this one from the family of a man who began smoking at age six and died of lung cancer 46 years later.
A jury in Marion County Superior Court was expected to begin deliberations in the case on Wednesday or Thursday.
The widow and three teenaged children of Richard Rogers, an Indianapolis lawyer who died at the age of 52 in 1987, are seeking unspecified damages.
The suit was moving toward a close as Kansas was set to become the 11th state to sue the tobacco industry to recover Medicaid costs of smokers, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general said Monday.
Kansas Attorney General Carla Stovall was to hold a news conference Tuesday to give details of the filing.
