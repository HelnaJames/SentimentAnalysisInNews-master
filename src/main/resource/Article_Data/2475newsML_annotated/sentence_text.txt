Haitham HaddadinBEIRUT 1996-08-20Lebanon's economic activitystagnateddue to a17-day Israeli blitzin April that caused $300 million indamages, a leadingBeirut banksaid on Tuesday
"Aggregate economic activitywas remarkablyhitby a newIsraeli aggression against Lebanonduring April that resulted in a greater degree ofstagnation,"Fransabanksaid in its economic report for the second quarter of 1996
"Based on some of theseunfavorable economic conditions, several domestic and foreign experts estimateLebanon's growth rateto run at nearly 3-4 percent this year, i
e
 half of its 1995 level," the bank added
The bank said theeconomic slowdownwas also the result ofpoor performancein some influential sectors andslower capital inflowsaccompanied by an upsurge in public debt that curtailed the private sector's ability to acquire investment funds
It said theApril 11-27 operationcaused $300 million indamagesto infrastructure likeelectricity, telecommunications, water and road networks, and to agricultural, industrial and trade enterprises along with housing and commercial units
Another leading bank, Banque Audi, had estimated damages at $400 million to $500 million in the attack, in which 200 people, mainly civilians, were killed
 Israel launched its "Operation Grapes of Wrath" operation to end Katyusha rocket attacks by Hizbollah guerrillas on northern Israel
Fransabank said that private sector initiative, coupled with wise monetary and financial policies, "could initiate a potential turn in economic prospects and lessen the sluggishness during the second half of 1996
"The military attack on southern Lebanon occured when the country had succeeded in transforming its market into a competitive regional centre by attracting international financial and banking institutions and entering international markets via Eurobond issues, it said
"This aggression, coupled by uncertain peace negotiations in the Middle East, has influenced to a large extent the current planned huge investments in the touristic sector, nearly $500 million, resulting perhaps in some delay," Fransabank said
The report said that public debt rose 8
2 percent in the second quarter to $8
4 billion, of which $7 billion was internal debt and $1
4 billion was external debt
 It said part of the increase in external debt was due to a $100-million Eurobond issue in May
The rise in public debt was largely due to growth in the budget deficit and the interest payments on public borrowing
The report said despite the adverse consequences of the Israeli operation, monetary stability continued to prevail over the period, when monetary authorities maintained twin policies of exchange rate stabilisation and relatively tight monetary policy
The pound improved in value to 1,571 to the U
S
 dollar at the end of June from 1,583
5 at the end of March, it added
The bank said the trade balance recorded a deficit of $1
5 billion in the second quarter but capital inflows offset the deficit and led to a second quarter balance of payments surplus of $7
8 million compared with a surplus of $29 million in the first quarter
