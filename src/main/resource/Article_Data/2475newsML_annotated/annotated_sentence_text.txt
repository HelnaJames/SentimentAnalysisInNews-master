Israeli blitz hurt Lebanon economy -- report.
Lebanon's economic activity stagnated due to a 17-day Israeli blitz in April that caused $300 million in damages, a leading  Beirut bank said on Tuesday.

"Aggregate economic activity was remarkably hit by a new Israeli aggression against Lebanon during April that resulted in a greater degree of stagnation," Fransabank said in its economic report for the second quarter of 1996.
"Based on some of these unfavorable economic conditions, several domestic and foreign experts estimate Lebanon's growth rate to run at nearly 3-4 percent this year, i.e. half of its 1995 level," the bank added.
The bank said the economic slowdown was also the result of poor performance in some influential sectors and slower capital inflows accompanied by an upsurge in public debt that curtailed the private sector's ability to acquire investment funds.
It said the April 11-27 operation caused $300 million in damages to infrastructure like electricity, telecommunications, water and road networks, and to agricultural, industrial and trade enterprises along with housing and commercial units.
