Saxony and the European Commission locked horns in June when the Commission approved only 540 million marks ($366 million) of a proposed 780 million marks in subsidies for Volkswagen to build two plants in the formerly communist east German state.
Volkswagen defends Saxony subsidy decision.
Ferdinand Piech, management board chairman of German carmaker Volkswagen, on Tuesday defended the decision by the Saxony government to pay subsidies to the company in defiance of a European Union ban.
"We believe that the decision by the premier of Saxony to grant subsidies to Volkswagen is a decision for the people and for jobs in Saxony.
This is also how we view our decision to invest in this location," Piech told journalists.
The group was introducing its new Passat vehicle.
