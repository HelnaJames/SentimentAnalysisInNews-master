12 billion pounds ($1
75 billion) in June,helping to easefears that economic recovery may have damaged the trade balance, according to figures released Wednesday

Thefigureswere betterthan financial markets had expected, although some economists predicted that the healthier tone could prove short-lived, with rising consumer demand likely toboostimportsin the coming months
TheTreasurysaid the figures demonstrated the strength of export growth but some economists found them puzzling
"The UK's trade performance continues to mystify us," saidAlex Garrard, an economist at stockbrokers UBS
"Import growth has slowed despite abundant evidence of an upswing in domestic demand
 Even more surprising is the buoyancy of export growth, despite reduced competitiveness against major European currencies since the turn of the year and only tentative signs of a pick-up in overseas activity
"Garrard said the trade data were notoriously erratic and the deficit could be revised higher in the coming months
There was better news on more up-to-date figures covering trade with countries outside the European Union in July
 This showed a July deficit of 506 million pounds ($788
8 million), half of the June shortfall of 1
09 billion ($1
67 billion)
Economists said the figures probably made it slightly less likely that Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, the nation's finance minister, would cut official interest rates again next month
Clarke has cut rates four times since December to their present 5
75 percent level
