ValuJet begins saftey "proving runs" with FAA.
ValuJet Inc. said it began two-days of federal safety "proving runs" Tuesday, in hopes of getting a regulatory green light to resume scheduled flights this week.
The discount carrier, which suspended operations in June amid a series of alleged safety violations and after a deadly crash, also has recalled 70 pilots and 100 flight attendants to staff flights to five cities in the event that ValuJet receives final approval from the Federal Aviation Administration.
FAA inspectors Tuesday morning began putting a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and two ValuJet crews through various flight exercises, including emergency procedures, said airline spokesman Gregg Kenyon
A ValuJet DC-9 crew consists of a pilot, a co-pilot and three flight attendants.
The proving runs were scheduled to continue through Wednesday afternoon.
