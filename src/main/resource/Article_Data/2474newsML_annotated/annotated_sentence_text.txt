Nile Delta proves fertile ground for natgas - Amoco.
A rapid succession of gas discoveries in Egyptian waters off the  Nile Delta are making the area one of the most promising in the world for the oil industry, a senior oil company executive said on Tuesday.
"Only now are we understanding the magnitude of the opportunity," Amoco Egypt vice president Gary Bose told Reuters in an interview.
 "As a whole, the basin could be world class."
Amoco, one of the leading companies in the field, has made nine discoveries in the past two years.
The company and its partners have identified five trillion cubic feet in the area and that could be just the tip of the iceberg.
