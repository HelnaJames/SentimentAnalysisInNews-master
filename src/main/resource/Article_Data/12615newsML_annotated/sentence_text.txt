Adam EntousSAN FRANCISCO 1996-08-24American adventurerSteve Fossett, who in 1995 completed the first solo crossing of the Pacific Ocean by balloon, on Saturdaybrokethe world speed recordfor crossing it solo by sail
Fossett, 52, sailed non-stop aboard his trimaran "Lakota" from Yokohama, Japan, to San Francisco in 20 days, 12 hours and 53 minutes,knocking three days offthespeed record set by John Omanin July 1994, according to Bo Kemper, Fossett's project manager
"This is Steve'sgreatest accomplishment in sailing
To be the world record holder in this will giveStevegreat personal satisfaction,"Kempersaid early on Saturday
The 4,525-nautical-mile journey officially ended on Saturday morning when Fossett's craft crossed beneath San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge
 It was Fossett's eighth world speed record in 24 months, said Kemper, speaking by phone from Chicago
Fossett's trimaran, with a maximum speed of 34 knots, was equipped with a global positioning system for navigation and a satellite imaging system for weather
 He spoke to Kemper throughout the journey through satellite communications
During his trip, Fossett, a Chicago securities dealer, struggled through days with little breeze to propel him and other days when 30 knot winds and 11-foot (three metre) waves battered his craft
Champagne was pouring dockside as his 60-foot (18-metre) carbon fiber craft sailed into the Schoonmaker Point Marina in Sausalito, across the bay from San Francisco
Fossett passed beneath the Golden Gate Bridge at 4:04 a
m
 PDT (1104 GMT on) Saturday, several hours later than expected, Kemper said
Fossett, who funded the voyage himself and had no sponsor, has devoted much of his time to going after world records in both sailing and ballooning
In February 1995, he became the first person to fly a balloon solo across the Pacific, taking off from South Korea and landing in a field in Saskatchewan, Canada
 His 6,000-mile (9,600-km) voyage set a new world absolute ballooning distance record
Then in August 1995, Fossett and three crew members sailed from Yokohama to San Francisco in 16 days, knocking almost five days off the old Japan-San Francisco sailing record of 21-1/2 days set by the clipper ship "James Stafford" in 1885
Also in 1995, Fossett knocked six hours off the Los Angeles-Honolulu sailing record
 He also holds Atlantic crossing records, by both balloon and sail
This year, Fossett was less fortunate
 He failed in a bold attempt in January to circle the globe in a balloon
 The daring voyage ended abruptly when he made a forced landing in a snow-covered Canadian pasture
Kemper said Fossett was planning this November to try once again to circumnavigate the globe by balloon
