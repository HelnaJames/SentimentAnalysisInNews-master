SAILING-U.S. ADVENTURER BREAK SAILING RECORD.
American adventurer Steve Fossett, who in 1995 completed the first solo crossing of the Pacific Ocean by balloon, on Saturday broke the world speed record for crossing it solo by sail.
Fossett, 52, sailed non-stop aboard his trimaran "Lakota" from Yokohama, Japan, to San Francisco in 20 days, 12 hours and 53 minutes, knocking three days off the speed record set by John Oman in July 1994, according to Bo Kemper, Fossett's project manager.
This is Steve's greatest accomplishment in sailing.
To be the world record holder in this will give Steve great personal satisfaction," Kemper said early on Saturday.
