Newbridge stock soars on solid earnings.
The stock of Newbridge Networks Corp. soared Wednesday after the maker of computer network equipment laid to rest lingering investor doubts about its earnings by posting a 64 percent increase in first-quarter profit.
The Kanata, Ontario-based company on Tuesday said earnings rose to Canadian $60.8 million ($44.4 million), or C70 cents a share (51 cents), in its fiscal first quarter ended on July 28, from C$37.1 million ($26.9 million), or C44 cents a share (32 cents), in the 1995 quarter.
The profits beat consensus estimates by two U.S. cents a share, and made plain that warnings about the company's first-quarter earnings from two analysts last month were unjustified, some industry analysts said.
It's a quarter that if you were a bear on Newbridge, you would have a very hard time finding anything to complain about
. It all looked great," said Robert MacLellan at Dillon Read in New York.
