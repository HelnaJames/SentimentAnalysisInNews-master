Netscape, others launch Internet affiliate
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif
Netscape Communications Corp
said Monday it formed a new company with other investors to develop software to help bring the Internet to consumers using telephones, video games and pagers
The announcement is the latest development in the battle between Netscape, which makes popular software to browse the World Wide Web, and Microsoft Corp
, as they race to make their systems the standard for the Internet
Jim Clark, the entrepreneur who co-founded Netscape and serves as its chairman, said the new business aims to address a market with as many as 500 million of the new devices over the next five years
Netscape said it will have a major stake in the new company,Navio Communications Inc
, which a spokeswoman said already has 50 employees and is "growing rapidly
"Netscape declined to elaborate on the other seven investors or on the size of individual investments
But it said Navio was working with leading consumer electronics and technology companies, including International Business Machines Corp
, Sony Corp
, Sega Enterprises Ltd
, Nintendo Co
 Ltd
, NEC Corp
, and Oracle Corp
Netscape planned a news conference in San Francisco at 10:30 a
m
 PDT (1:30 p
m
 EDT) to discuss the new company
Netscape said Dr
 Wei Yen will be president, chief executive officer and a board director of Navio
 Yen was previously senior vice president of products and technologies at Silicon Graphics Inc
Netscape said Navio would first work to enhance existing Internet content by making it readily viewable on a host of devices other than personal computers, such as phones, televisions and pagers
Navio's software will be based on Netscape technology as part of a strategy to extend Netscape's reach to a broader range of devices that may become programmable and interconnected using the Internet global computer network
"The Internet is already transforming the way people work
 After today, it will transform the way people live," Clark said of the formation of Navio
The strategy is similar to one launched by Microsoft in the early 1990s, when the Redmond, Wash
-based software company tried to install scaled-down versions of its Windows software on photocopiers and other office machines
 Microsoft already dominates the market for personal computer software
Mountain View, Calif
-based Netscape, which went public a year ago with great fanfare, has about 80 percent of the market for Internet browser software
A Netscape lawyer has asked the Justice Department to investigate allegations that Microsoft has been improperly using inducements to promote its own browser software
Microsoft has denied any wrongdoing and has countered with its own complaints that Netscape has not kept its technology open
The war of words comes as the two companies have launched new versions of browser software -- Netscape Navigator 3
0 and Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3
0 -- in a fierce battle for control over a key Internet software market
Navio is working to make Netscape Navigator into smaller, modular software that can be easily integrated into the less powerful hardware of non-PC devices
"Today, Netscape Navigator has reached more than 40 million users on traditional computer platforms
 In the next five years, Navio and Netscape together can bring the Netscape Navigator platform to potentially more than 500 million devices applicable to consumers and businesses," said Marc Andreessen, Netscape senior vice president of technology
Yen said the types of devices the software will address range from game devices and phones to automobiles
Netscape's stock gained $1 to $39 in midday trading on Nasdaq
