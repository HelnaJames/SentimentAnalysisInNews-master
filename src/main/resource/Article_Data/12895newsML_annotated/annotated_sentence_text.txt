Bass buys Allied's stake in Carlsberg-Tetley.
British brewing giant Bass said on Sunday it had bought Allied Domecq's stake in Carlsberg-Tetley for 200 million pounds ($310 million).
The purchase includes Allied Domecq's 50 percent share of Carlsberg-Tetley as well as their beer brands.
Bass added it is to merge Carlsberg-Tetley and Bass Brewers, conditional on regulatory approval.
Assuming the merger is completed, Bass expects within three years to achieve annual cost savings of 90 million pounds, with additional one-off cash costs of 75 million pounds.
