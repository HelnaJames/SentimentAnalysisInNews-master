On Tuesday, India prevented the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) from being adopted at disarmament talks in Geneva.
The treaty, which supporters would like to forward to the United Nations General Assembly over India's objections, includes a clause which could provide for eventual, unspecified measures to encourage countries to ratify the pact.
India has expressed concern that the measures could involve punitive sanctions aimed at forcing it to approve the treaty.
India sees no economic fallout from nuclear stance.
India does not expect its opposition to a global nuclear test ban treaty to damage economic relations with the rest of the world, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said on Wednesday.
"I have been assured we don't expect any economic fallout and hope there would not be any economic fallout," Chidambaram told reporters in the Indian capital.
