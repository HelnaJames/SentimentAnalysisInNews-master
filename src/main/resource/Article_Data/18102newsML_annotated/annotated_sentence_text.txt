Rugby union-England given until end of next week to change mind.
England have been given until the end of next week to change their mind about an exclusive television deal with Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television and stay in the Five Nations' championship.
Scotland Rugby Football Union president Fred McLeod said on Wednesday if there was no change in the Rugby Football Union's (RFU) approach England would be excluded from the championship
The championship, featuring England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France, is one of the most popular sporting contests in the British Isles.
But last April England infuriated their championship colleagues when they decided to sign a 87.5 million pounds sterling ($135.8 million) deal giving Sky television exclusive rights to rugby union matches in England.
"We have given the RFU every opportunity to modify its approach to the sale of broadcasting rights, prior to and following England's exclusion from the Five Nations' championship," McLeod said.
