"The television personality's planned suit is the latest in a host of legal attacks on the tobacco industry
 On Thursday alone, a key smoker's case is expected to go to an Indianapolis jury and Oklahoma became the 14th state to sue the industry to recoup health care costs
On Friday, the White House plans to announce its endorsement of Food and Drug Administration regulations aimed at keeping cigarettes away from children
Downey underwent surgery in July at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles, where doctors removed an inch-and-a-half diameter tumour from the upper lobe of Downey's right lung
Downey, 63, who used to be a strong advocate of smokers' rights, announced last month that his lung cancer was the result of 50 years of smoking
He recently made an anti-smoking public service announcement on behalf of the American Lung Association
Downey was dubbed "The Mouth" for his sometimes confrontational style, in which he often jabbed a cigarette in the faces of audience and guests on his popular syndicated TV show in the late 1980s
A former board member of the National Smokers Alliance, Downey resigned in January
"I realised that the major tobacco companies were lying when they said they weren't adding dangerous levels of nicotine to cigarette tobacco
 They're nothing but tobacco terrorists," he had said
Kramer said the Downey suit will be filed in Newark, N
J
 federal court and will be brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act
Last week Kramer filed two other RICO actions against the tobacco industry in New York and New Jersey and will be filing a third Friday in Newark, N
J
, federal court
 He said he believes that the cases were the first to name Shook Hardy as a defendant
One suit was brought Aug
 12 in Newark federal court by Judy Mantel, a 61-year-old New Jersey resident who had smoked for 45 years and has been diagnosed with lung cancer
The other suit was filed Aug
 13 in the New York Supreme Court in Queens County by four plaintiffs one of whom wrote advertising copy about Kent cigarettes
The complaints alleged that the tobacco industry has lied about its knowledge of the addictive nature of nicotine
The suits also alleged that the defendants have controlled the amount of nicotine "with the effect of creating and sustaining the addiction of plaintiffs
"To support the racketeering claims, the plaintiffs cite internal industry documents and testimony by tobacco companies' chief executives in 1994 congressional hearings at which they denied that nicotine is addictive
The lawsuits also alleged that the Shook Hardy firm designated certain documents as confidential by wrongfully claiming that they were protected by attorney client privilege
