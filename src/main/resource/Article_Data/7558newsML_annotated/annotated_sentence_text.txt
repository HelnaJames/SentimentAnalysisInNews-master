Morton Downey to file tobacco suit.
Former talk show host Morton Downey, Jr. who has contracted lung cancer, is planning to sue the tobacco industry and the Kansas City, Mo., law firm of Shook, Hardy &amp; Bacon, his lawyer said Thursday.
Steven Kramer, Downey's New York City lawyer, told Reuters that the suit will be filed next month in New Jersey where Downey had lived and his show was produced.
Downey now lives in Sherman Oaks, Calif.
"He wants to speak out to stop young people from smoking," Kramer said.
"He's very angry at the tobacco companies for not telling the truth about nicotine."
