Dollar rises vs. yen after trade report.
NEW YORK, Aug 20 - The dollar rose against the Japanese yen Tuesday after a sharp drop in the nation's trade deficit overshadowed fleeting disappointment that the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged.
The Commerce Department reported the United States trade gap shrank 23 percent in June as imports of merchandise and petroleum fell sharply.
While the trade shortfall with Japan rose 3.6 percent in June, the second-quarter deficit of $10.5 billion with Japan was the smallest quarterly deficit in five years.
The trend helped the dollar by decreasing the amount of dollars foreign exporters will need to sell for their local currencies.
