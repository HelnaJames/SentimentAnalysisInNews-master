The dollar ended European trading sharply down against the mark and yen on Monday with the markets nervous over Tokyo's monetary direction ahead of a key Japanese economic survey due this week.
The dollar at the close had slipped by nearly a pfennig and a yen compared with Friday's levels in dealings that were subdued because British markets were shut for a seasonal holiday.
The weaker dollar had a depressing effect on the main European bourses, which ended down after business that was quiet because of London's closure.
A poor performance on Wall Street did nothing to dispel the gloom.
The dollar's closing level of 107.55 yen compared to Friday's 108.50 was prompted by a growing uncertainty over the direction of Japan's monetary policy.
