Air fare row grounds Virgin's Swiss launch.
"We have been denied the right to offer the kind of low fares that have been the trademark of this company, Virgin Express chief executive Jonathan Ornstein said in a statement.
A spokesman for Virgin Group, British owner of the Belgian based airline, said Swiss authorities had objected to Virgin proposals to undercut by 50 percent the fares of Swissair and its Belgian affiliate Sabena
"We were hoping to offer a regular one-way fare of 115 Swiss francs ($97) with a special launch offer of 86 francs but the Swiss authorities have utterly refused to let us fly on the basis of that fare," spokesman Will Whitehorn said
Instead Virgin has rejected an offer to be allowed to set a limited-availability return fare of 298 francs -- 25 percent of the full-fare price of 1,190 francs listed by Swissair and Sabena -- and vowed to fight for the right to discount more.
European cut-price airline Virgin Express said on Tuesday that Swiss objections to its low fares forced it to call off plans for a new Brussels-Geneva service on September 2.
