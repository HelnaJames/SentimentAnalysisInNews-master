Bidding war for Chateau Properties escalates.
The bidding war for mobile home community operator Chateau Properties Inc. escalated Wednesday as rival Sun Communities Inc. made an unsolicited, $372 million stock offer for the firm.
The new bid is aimed at derailing a $387 million cash offer made Monday by Chicago-based Manufactured Home Communities Inc., which is controlled by investor Samuel Zell.
 Zell also offered the option of a stock deal that would be worth $316 million based on the current stock price of Manufactured Home, or a combination of cash and stock.
Both offers appeared to leave Englewood, Colo.-based ROC Communities in the dust.
 ROC and Chateau, based in Clinton Township, Mich., agreed to merge last month in a tax-free stock swap that offered no premium to Chateau shareholders
