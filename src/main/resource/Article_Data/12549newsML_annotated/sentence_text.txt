Relations between China and Taiwantook atumblelast week over Taiwan Vice-President Lien Chan's secret mission to Ukraine, which recognises Beijing
On Thursday, Taipei and Beijing each called for a resumption of talks broken off more than a year ago, although China's anger over Lien's secret Kiev visit is widely seen to have dampened hopes for any breakthrough
Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province not entitled to foreign ties and has scorned even allies whom it sees as giving political quarter to the island's leaders
However, Jiang, in discussions in Beijing, had reiterated the need to stay away from "over-hasty" and excessively aggressive measures, the newspaper reported
Following his remarks, the Chinese Politburo had ruled out war games and other forms of "missile diplomacy" in the foreseeable future, the newspaper said
