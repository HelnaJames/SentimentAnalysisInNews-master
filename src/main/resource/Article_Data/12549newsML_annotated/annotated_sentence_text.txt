China president warns against strong-arm tactics on Taiwan.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has warned against using strong-arm tactics against Taiwan as they would destabilise Hong Kong's 1997 return to Chinese rule, a newspaper reported on Saturday.
Beijing had decided instead to continue the "economic united front" policy to put pressure on Taiwan, the South China Morning Post reported, quoting unidentified China sources.
Jiang was quoted by Chinese sources as saying that a new flare-up in the Taiwan Strait would be "prejudicial to Hong Kong's peacful transition to the motherland", it reported.
The British colony reverts to China at midnight on June 30, 1997.
Relations between China and Taiwan took a tumble last week over Taiwan Vice-President Lien Chan's secret mission to Ukraine, which recognises Beijing.
