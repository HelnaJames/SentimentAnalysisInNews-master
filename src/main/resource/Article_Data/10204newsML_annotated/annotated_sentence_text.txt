Britain's blue chip stocks advanced to a new peak at Friday's opening, thanks to a 43-point rise in the Dow yesterday and the followthrough effect of yesterday's sizeable cut in the German repo rate, dealers said.
The FTSE 100 started 16.5 points up at 3,907.6, beating the previous trading high of 3,894.4 made on August 21.
It's a squeezy market
 But the fact that its gone through 3,900 in a reasonably big way is encouraging," a trader said.
Second line stocks were also higher, with the Mid-250 scoring a 9.1 points gain at 4,411.6, but standing nearly 160 points below its best closing level made in late April.
