Tiger Woods advanced to the semifinals of the U.S. Amateur Golf Championship in Cornelius, Oregon, when he bettered D.A. Points, 3 and 2, in a quarterfinal match at the Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club on Friday.
Woods, in search of an unprecedented third straight U.S. Amateur title, set up a meeting with Stanford University teammate Joel Kribelm, who had to go to an extra hole before getting by Duke Delcher.
The other semifinal pits Robert Floyd, the son of Senior PGA Tour mainstay Raymond Floyd, and Steve Scott.
 Floyd closed out Bryan Novoa by getting 2 up.
Scott was 1 down on the 16th hole, but rallied to beat 1995 finalist Buddy Marucci, 1 up.
