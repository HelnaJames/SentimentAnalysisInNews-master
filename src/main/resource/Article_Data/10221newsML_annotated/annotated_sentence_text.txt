President Bill Clinton, endorsing a plan broadening the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) powers, approved rules to curb teen smoking by restricting the sale and advertising of tobacco, the White House said on Friday.
Against a backdrop of election-year politics, Clinton publicly embraced a controversial plan that has been softened from a more stringent approach unveiled last August.
"The president has accepted and authorized" the FDA action after an internal administration review, White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said.
The restrictions include limiting vending machine sales and curbing advertising aimed at young people.
McCurry said Clinton "in essence has accepted ... that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are delivery devices" for nicotine, which the administration believes qualifies them to fall under the authority of the FDA.
Clinton approves FDA curbs on teen smoking.
