German stocks close steady before weekend.
German equities ended on Friday almost unchanged from closing levels on Thursday, as a weaker dollar and softer German bonds weighed on trading sentiment.
Despite support from a strong close on Wall Street overnight and a positive reaction to the Bundesbank's decision to cut the securities repurchase, or repo, rate on Thursday, shares could not find direction over the floor-trade session.
At the end of bourse trade the DAX index, which measures floor trade in 30 blue-chip shares, was down 2.10 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,555.16 points.
The IBIS DAX index, which measures all-day electronic trade in German blue-chips, ended the day up 2.70 at 2,562.12.
"Sentiment is definitely warmer after the repo cut
 We're not really going to see any kind of trend until Monday," said one Frankfurt trader.
