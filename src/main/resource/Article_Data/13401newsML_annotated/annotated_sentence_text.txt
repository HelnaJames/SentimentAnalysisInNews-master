Its shares dropped 1.5 percent to 208 marks on the news.
Disappointing growth in passenger and freight volumes limited expansion and the airline said its German business was hit by a flood of cheap flights from subsidised airlines, excess capacity and a fatal fire in April at Duesseldorf airport.
To compensate, it pledged to cut its spending budget for the rest of the year by 190 million marks, or three percent, as well as removing five aircraft from service and trimming staff accordingly.
 Price war hurts Lufthansa earnings
German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG on Monday blamed a 37 percent slump in its first-half profit mainly on price slashing by European rivals but said its full-year earnings should be stable.
The carrier posted pre-tax profit of 119 million marks for the first six months of 1996, sharply below the year-ago period's 189 million although slightly better than an estimate in July that profits would drop to 100 million marks.
