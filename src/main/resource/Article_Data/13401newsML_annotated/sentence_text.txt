Catherine O'MahonyFRANKFURT 1996-08-26German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG on Mondayblamed a 37 percent slumpin itsfirst-half profitmainly onprice slashingby European rivals but said itsfull-year earningsshould be stable

Disappointing growthinpassenger and freight volumeslimited expansionandthe airlinesaid itsGerman businesswashitby a flood of cheap flights from subsidised airlines, excess capacity and a fatal fire in April at Duesseldorf airport
To compensate, it pledged to cut its spending budget for the rest of the year by 190 million marks, or three percent, as well as removing five aircraft from service and trimming staff accordingly
"As a result of these measures, the management board expects to be able to achieve earnings for the full year of 1996 which are comparable with year-ago levels, given stable currencies and a sales rise of five percent," Lufthansa said
Its pre-tax profit from ordinary activities rose to 756
4 million marks in 1995
Sales in the first half of this year climbed 6
6 percent to 9
8 billion marks despite lower turnover at Lufthansa Cargo
 Lufthansa AG, Condor Flugdienst, Lufthansa CityLine and Lufthansa Technik all contributed to the advance
A Lufthansa spokesman said the German carrier's main price rival in the first half was Air France, which launched a strong assault on the lower end of the market
"There were Air France price cuts of up to 30 percent," he said, noting that the rivalry with the French carrier extended to non-European flights as well as French-German routes
Lufthansa has repeatedly criticised rival airlines for using state subsidies to fund what it sees as unrealistic prices
However, it distanced itself from an aggressive attempt by one of its sales teams to redress the balance in Lufthansa's favour, reported in the German press on Monday
The carrier's North Bavarian sales team had sent letters to around 20 travel agents encouraging them to keep the British Airways share of the German market below 15 percent from mid-October through mid-December this year or risk getting worse terms of business from Lufthansa
Lufthansa said the incident was unauthorised and that there would be "consequences" for the department involved
The airline said passenger numbers virtually stalled at 19
7 million in the first six months of 1996
 Freight and mail volume grew by 2
8 percent to 808,600 tonnes
The Duesseldorf fire, which closed the airport for several days, caused Lufthansa to lose at least a high two-digit million mark figure in revenue, the spokesman said
Lufthansa said it would give top priority this year to its cost-cutting programme, which aims to reduce unit costs by around 20 percent by 2001 in a bid to compensate for high German wage costs and the strong mark
As well as cutting spending, the airline said it planned to take three planes from its short-range and medium-range fleet and two from its long-distance fleet
 The planes are likely to be sold, the spokesman said
