UK: INTERVIEW- Bass steeled for regulatory haul
INTERVIEW-Bass steeled for regulatory haul
LONDON 1996-08-25British brewer Bass has steeled itself for the possibility of a long haul to obtain the regulatory approval needed for a complex deal giving it control of Carlsberg-Tetley, the brewing venture owned by Allied Domecq and Denmark's Carlsberg
"We are prepared for a long haul to do that," Bass Brewers' chiefIain Napiertold Reuters, commenting on what would happen if the deal went to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC)
Buthewashopeful that there would be a speedy resolution to any MMC inquiry-- within an eight to nine month period
"We've tried to keep the regulator informed all the waythrough this deal," saidNapier
"We are hopeful that they can say there's nothing wrong with what we're doing
"Bass announced earlier the long-awaited purchase of Allied Domecq's 50 percent stake in Carlsberg-Tetley for 200 million stg
 Carlsberg has agreed to contribute its interests and 20 million stg in exchange for a 20 percent share of the combined Bass Brewers and Carlsberg-Tetley business
The agreement gives Bass 35 percent of the British beer market and, according to rival brewing group Whitbread, makes a referral to the MMC likely
Bass said it could return Carlsberg's share if it did notlike the regulatory terms
 Napier said Bass would have to look at all the options available to it in the event of a referral
"We have to see what the regulators come up with
 We will then decide from a business perspective whether or not that makes sense for us and what that mix of options are," he said
Whitbread suggested brands may be released
Bass is to take a one-off cost of 75 million pounds for restructuring the combined business following the merger of Carlsberg-Tetley with Bass Brewers
Napier said this would go towards achieving the efficiencies which would result in the 90 million pounds annual savingsoutlined earlier by Bass
 He said there would be redundancies
"There will be some redundancy costs of course, I'd be naive to suggest there wouldn't
 We hope that redundancies will be lower with us than they would have been with C-T because they would have to have taken some action anyway," said Napier
He said he did not know how many job losses there would be
"We hope that by bringing together another company we'll be able to get synergistic benefit out of that
 Sales forces are covering similar territories
 By integrating both of those we'll be able gain enormous efficiencies
