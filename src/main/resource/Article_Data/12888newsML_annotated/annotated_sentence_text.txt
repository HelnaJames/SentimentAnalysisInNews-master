"We've tried to keep the regulator informed all the way through this deal," said Napier.
"We are hopeful that they can say there's nothing wrong with what we're doing."
Bass steeled for regulatory haul.
British brewer Bass has steeled itself for the possibility of a long haul to obtain the regulatory approval needed for a complex deal giving it control of Carlsberg-Tetley, the brewing venture owned by Allied Domecq and Denmark's Carlsberg.
"We are prepared for a long haul to do that," Bass Brewers' chief Iain Napier told Reuters, commenting on what would happen if the deal went to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC).
But he was hopeful that there would be a speedy resolution to any MMC inquiry -- within an eight to nine month period.
