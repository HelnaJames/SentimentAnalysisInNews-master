Levi Strauss launches new slacks line.
Levi Strauss &amp; Co. said Tuesday it was launching a line of slacks meant to appeal to men who don't like suits, in only the third major brand introduction in the company's 140-year history.
The new slacks, to be called Slates, will be marketed as dressier than the company's famous jeans or its Dockers pants brand, but not as formal as suits.
The pants, to be aimed at men in their 30s and 40s who grew up wearing Levi's jeans and Dockers khakis, are meant to give a big boost to the San Francisco-based clothing company, though how well men accept the new line remains to be seen, industry analysts said.
"We're going to awaken a sleeping giant of a category that we think has enormous potential," Jann Westfall, president of the Slates brand, said in a statement.
Those men want something different to wear as the workplace gets more casual, "a new look for business and social occasions that falls between casual cotton pants and suits," Westfall said.
