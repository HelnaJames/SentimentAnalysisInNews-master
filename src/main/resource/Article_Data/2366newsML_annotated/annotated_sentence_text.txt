BSkyB sees digital TV link with BT.
Satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting could link up with British Telecom to provide new services when it launches digital television next year.
BSkyB is planning to launch digital satellite television late next year and is reportedly talking to a number of partners about promoting and subsidising the launch.
"That is a possibility," said BSkyB chief executive Sam Chisholm when asked about the prospect of linking with BT to supply interactive services.
"We need to be able to get decoders to customers at the best price," said Chisholm. 
"There is no question that there is a very big demand for it (digital satellite) if you can get it right," he added.
