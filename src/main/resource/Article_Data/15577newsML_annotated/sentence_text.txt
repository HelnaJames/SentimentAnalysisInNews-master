BUDAPEST 1996-08-27Theprivatisation of Hungary's MATAV telecommunications companylacked vision and was irregular, theState Audit Officesaid according to newspaper reports
Theprivatisationwasinadequately plannedandfailed to consistently representthestate's interests, theHungarian daily Nepszabadsagsaid on Tuesday in an article about the audit office's report, which has not yet been published
State privatisation agency APV Rt officials were not immediately available for comment while the State Audit Office confirmed the report's existence but said it is not finished
"The report is confidential and has yet to be completed and submitted to the parliament," saidPeter Divinyiof the Audit Office's press department
According to the newspaper, the report says that after the first stage of MATAV's privatisation when German-American consortium MagyarCom acquired a 30 percent stake in the company for 87
5 billion forints ($580
5 million) , the state ploughed another 40 billion forints into it, giving the buyers a more valuable company
In addition, the minority owner had rights normally reserved to majority owners
Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech own 50 percent each of the joint venture MagyarCom
The drive for immediate state income led to a closed second round of privatisation, when instead of a bourse listing and an open tender, the minority owners could buy a further 37 percent stake in MATAV, the report said
The majority owner is registered in the Cayman Islands, but Hungarian corporate law does not recognise off-shore consortiums
 Thus, it is unclear how the company will repay the state-guaranteed loans
As Hungary's biggest telecommunications company, MATAV is obliged by law to meet some national security requirements
 These seemed to have been overlooked during privatisation, the report said
MATAV, the monopoly holder of national cable telecommunications, could also lose some 20 billion forints as a result of its investments in loss-making local telecommunications companies, the report said
