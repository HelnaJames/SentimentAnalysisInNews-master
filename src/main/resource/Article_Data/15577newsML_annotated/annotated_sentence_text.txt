Audit says Hungary telecom selloff irregular-press.
The privatisation of Hungary's MATAV telecommunications company lacked vision and was irregular, the State Audit Office said according to newspaper reports.
The privatisation was inadequately planned and failed to consistently represent the state's interests, the Hungarian daily Nepszabadsag said on Tuesday in an article about the audit office's report, which has not yet been published.
State privatisation agency APV Rt officials were not immediately available for comment while the State Audit Office confirmed the report's existence but said it is not finished
"The report is confidential and has yet to be completed and submitted to the parliament," said Peter Divinyi of the Audit Office's press department.
According to the newspaper, the report says that after the first stage of MATAV's privatisation when German-American consortium MagyarCom acquired a 30 percent stake in the company for 87.5 billion forints ($580.5 million) , the state ploughed another 40 billion forints into it, giving the buyers a more valuable company.
