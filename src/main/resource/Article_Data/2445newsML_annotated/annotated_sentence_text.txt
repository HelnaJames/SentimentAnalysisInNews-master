Malaysia's Maybank net meets expectations.
Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) on Tuesday posted full-year results that were in line with or slightly above market expectations, belying fears they would fall below estimates, analysts said on Tuesday.
Net profit at the nation's largest bank for the year ended June 30, 1996, rose to 1.07 billion ringgit ($428 million), or 94 cents a share, from 863.53 million ringgit, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier.
That was a shade above forecasts of around 1.04 billion ringgit, or 91 cents a share.
I think (the result) was slightly above market expectations, but it was very much in line with my estimate of 1.094 billion," said Gan Kim Khoon, an analyst at James Capel.
I would say it should do some good for the share price.
