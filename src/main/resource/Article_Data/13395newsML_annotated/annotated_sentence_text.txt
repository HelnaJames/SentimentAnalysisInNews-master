Japan's Hashimoto bears gifts for Brazil.

Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto met Brazil's President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on Monday, bearing gifts in the form of $510 million for environmental projects, officials said.
On a 10-day Latin American tour intended to show Japanese firms the region was again ripe for investment after the "Lost Decade" of the debt crises and 1980s hyperinflation, Hashimoto had been expected to focus on bilateral issues with Cardoso
Hashimoto's spokesman said on Sunday that multilateral issues, such as reform of the United Nations and progress on a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, might also be raised.
After their 1-1/2 hour talks on Monday, Cardoso and Hashimoto were to preside over the signing of $510 million in Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) financing for four environmental projects in Brazil.
They included programmes in the states of Parana and Santa Catarina, a project to clean the Bay of All Saints in Salvador in Brazil's northeast and a wind-powered energy project in the northern state of Ceara.
