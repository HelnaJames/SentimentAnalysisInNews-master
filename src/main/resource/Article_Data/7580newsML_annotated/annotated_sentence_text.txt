Canon's six-month profits zoom, sees record year.
Japanese camera and office equipment maker Canon said Thursday its profits more than doubled in the first six months of this year, thanks to its thriving computer printer business.
Canon also forecast record full-year current profits, for a second consecutive year, despite the impact of a slump in the microchip sector on its second-half results.
Canon said its parent current profit for the January-June period surged to 63.74 billion yen ($590 million), helped by a 32 percent rise in sales of laser-jet and bubble-jet printers.
The yen's lower value against the U.S. dollar and German mark also contributed 30 billion yen ($277 million) to its profits during the period, Canon said.
Exports account for 80 percent of Canon's sales.
