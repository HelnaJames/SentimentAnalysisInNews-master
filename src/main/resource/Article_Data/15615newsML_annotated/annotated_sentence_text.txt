Rexrodt said fresh discussions would take place on all levels in the next few days, but that preparatory work on a possible complaint by Bonn would continue.
FOCUS-Rexrodt sees some de-escalation in VW case.
German economics minister Guenter Rexrodt said on Tuesday he sees signs from the European Union of an easing of tensions over disputed subsidies by the state of Saxony to auto maker Volkswagen AG.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet discussed whether to file a complaint with the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg in the case, but reached no decision at its regular meeting on Tuesday, Rexrodt told Reuters
The government will continue to prepare its case, but will hold off taking action for now, he said.
"The German government stands on the side of Saxony and Volkswagen, which deserves to get the full allotment of subsidies," Rexrodt said.
