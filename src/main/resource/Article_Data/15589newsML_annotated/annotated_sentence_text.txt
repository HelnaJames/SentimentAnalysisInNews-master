Ingram Micro names Jerry Stead chairman.
Ingram Micro Inc., the world's largest distributor of microcomputer products, Tuesday named Jerre Stead chairman and chief executive, effective immediately.
Stead is the former chairman and chief executive officer of Legent Corp. before its acquisition by Computer Associates International Inc. and of AT&amp;T Corp.'s Global Information Solutions (NCR Corp.).
Stead replaces Lindwood Lacy, who left in May due to "irreconcilable differences" over how the $1.8 billion company would be run in its final months before a planned spin-off from its parent, Nashville-based Ingram Industries Inc.
