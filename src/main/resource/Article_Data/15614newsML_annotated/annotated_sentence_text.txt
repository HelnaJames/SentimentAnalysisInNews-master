PLO, Israeli minister meet on economic accord.
Palestinian Trade Minister Maher al-Masri said on Tuesday that Israel's Finance Minister Dan Meridor promised in a meeting to find ways to ease a crippling closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip
But neither Masri nor Meridor gave specifics.
Meridor said the two sides agreed to resume economic cooperation halted since last February by holding monthly meetings of the joint Palestinian-Israeli economic committee.
He added that Israel and the Palestinians would be meeting in the next few weeks to coordinate positions ahead of the September 5 meeting of international donors who have pledged aid to the peace process
"Mr Meridor said he would study ways to ease the closure which he said harmed the Palestinians," Masri told Reuters after the meeting.
