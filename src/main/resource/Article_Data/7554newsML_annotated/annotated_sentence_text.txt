Edmondson said conservative figures indicate Oklahoma spent about $70 million a year in Medicaid contributions since 1980 treating patients with smoking-related illnesses.
Oklahoma becomes 14th state to sue tobacco industry.
Oklahoma on Thursday became the 14th state to sue the tobacco industry, seeking to recover more than $1 billion in state Medicaid funds spent to treat smoking-related illnesses.
Attorney General Drew Edmondson, a Democrat who has accepted campaign contributions from the industry, said the suit alleged tobacco makers misled consumers about the health risks of smoking and manipulated nicotine levels to keep smokers hooked on cigarettes.
"Tobacco manufacturers have deliberately misled the public for years about the devastating impact their product has on the health of our people," he said.
"In the name of profits they have secretly manipulated nicotine levels."
