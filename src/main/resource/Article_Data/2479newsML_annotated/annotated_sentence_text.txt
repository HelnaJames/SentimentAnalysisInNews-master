Iran pins hope on Petronas deal to ease isolation.
Tehran is banking on Malaysia's Petronas acquisition of a 30 percent stake in a project to develop two oil and gas fields in Iran to deflect intense U.S. efforts to isolate the Islamic republic.

 It also indicates that the U.S. position is not shared by foreign oil companies," an Iranian oil official told Reuters by telephone from Tehran on Tuesday.
The official predicted the deal "will have a positive impact" on other foreign companies seeking business in Iran's lucrative oil and gas industries.
 "The deal indicates that the U.S. cannot dictate its own will."
