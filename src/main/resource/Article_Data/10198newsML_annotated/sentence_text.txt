UK: Rally in UK shares seen fading despite record
Rally in UK sharesseenfadingdespite record
Simon CowellLONDON 1996-08-23As theshackles of interest rate worriesdroppedfrom financial markets,London sharesleaptthrough 3,900 for the first time on Friday
But as the next big target -- 4,000 -- for the FTSE 100 index of Britain's leading companies comes into view, market strategists were questioning whether the surge is sustainable
Thegainsof the past month have certainly been dramatic -- a near 300 pointrisesince July 16 and arebound from the year's low to its highwithin the space of five weeks
The latest push to shares came on Thursday from interest rate cuts across Europe in the wake of an easing in monetary policy by Germany's Bundesbank
That move followed a stream of welcome data for markets through August whichcalmed fearsaboutoverheating economiesandinflation in both Britain and the U
S
Even after August's rise, valuations on the stock market are not stretched, say strategists
 But identifying the factors that might provide the impetus to continue the rally are difficult
"It's not that far away but I would be moderately surprised to see 4,000 in the ultra short term
 The market has rallied very quickly from the sell-off in the early part of July when Wall Street was under pressure," said UBS strategist Tim Brown
Another quick surge forward is unlikely, particularly with the prospect of downbeat comments and disappointing results from the looming manufacturing sector's results season, says Brown
And uncertainty about U
S
 and British interest rates, a fast-approaching British election and November budget are all likely to play a part in capping the soaring stock market
The gains in the market this week, with new highs on five out of six days, came as markets took heart from the larger than expected German rate cut and the U
S
 Federal Reserve's decision to leave rates there unchanged
But Brown said it is difficult to see interest rates driving shares much further, and another cut in British rates -- normally taken as good news -- may not please markets this time
"There's sufficient uncertainty between the view of the politicians and the Bank of England -- and quite a few economists -- that the market will see it as a worrying sign because of the risk of overheating," said Brown
Yet the recent rally in the bond market has helped provide leeway for August's advance in share prices
"Whenever equities have tried to rally in the past it's been constrained by tight domestic valuations relative to gilts
 This time there's been no trigger saying hang on, equities look expensive to gilts'," said BZW strategist Steve Wright
A slowing in the flow of new issues, privatisations and rights issues, switching into cyclical stocks and continuing bid speculation have provided other boosts
"We could see the market move a little forward but we have a year end target of 3,750 and if the market were to get to 4,000 it would probably be an ideal selling opportunity," said Wright
The long holiday weekend period in Britain, where financial markets are closed on Monday, gives investors a chance to catch their breath and a period of consolidation is likely
British economic and company news is thin on the ground next week and attention is set to shift back to the U
S
But with levels of cash held by institutional investors relatively high, pressure to put money back into the market may yet provide further fuel to the rally
"There's quite a lot of cash out there and quite a lot of people will be nervous
 All the data through August has been one way


and the turnaround in interest rate sentiment, if it's sustained, will add to that pressure (to put money into market)," said SBC Warburg strategist George Hodgson
