Downey, in a telephone interview from his Sherman Oaks, Calif. home, said he had never agreed to take such action.
 He said that Kramer had written him asking him to be a named plaintiff in a class action suit.
"He said I would be a perfect lightening rod for a class action," Downey said.
Downey said he called Kramer and refused to participate.
Downey denies he filing tobacco suit.
Talk show host Morton Downey Jr., who recently underwent surgery for lung cancer, on Saturday denied a lawyer's statement that he planned to sue the tobacco industry for his illness.
Steven Kramer, a New York City personal injury lawyer who has filed several cases against the industry, said last week that Downey was one of his clients and that he was preparing a tobacco suit on Downey's behalf.
