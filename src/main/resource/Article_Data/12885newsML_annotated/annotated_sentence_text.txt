Bass braced for MMC probe in Carlsberg-Tetley deal.
British brewing giant Bass has struck a complex deal giving it control of Carlsberg-Tetley, the brewing venture owned by Allied Domecq and Denmark's Carlsberg.
The agreement, announced by Bass on Sunday, gives Bass a 35 percent share of the British beer market, but faces regulatory hurdles including a possible referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC).
Bass has paid 200 million pounds for Allied Domecq's 50 percent stake in the venture.
 Carlsberg will have a 20 percent interest in the combined Bass Brewers and Carlsberg-Tetley.
