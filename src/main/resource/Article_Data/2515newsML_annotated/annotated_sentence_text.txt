Chrysler sets plans for $315 million Brazil plant.
Chrysler Corp. said Tuesday it plans to build a $315 million plant in Brazil and boost production at a plant being built in Argentina to expand its presence in South America.
The investment in Argentina will be $65 million, the nation's third-largest automaker said
The company has lagged behind rivals General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. in expanding overseas.
The new Brazilian plant, which will be Chrysler's third in South America, will assemble the compact Dakota pickup truck for sale in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, the countries in the so-called Mercosur free-trade zone.
A site for the Brazilian plant will be selected by year-end and vehicles will roll of the assembly line starting in mid-1998, Chrysler said.
