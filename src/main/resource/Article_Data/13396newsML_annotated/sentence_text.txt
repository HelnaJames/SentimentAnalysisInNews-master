John Tuccillo, chief economist for the Realtors' association, said some falloff in sales was normal after the extraordinarily brisk rate of business earlier in the year
"Any time a new record is set in the pace of sales, it's inevitable that some slowdown will follow," he said, adding that the July sales rate still was higher than that posted for any single month in 1995
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp
, or Fannie Mae, said the average rate for a 30-year mortgage loan in July was 8
25 percent, down from 8
32 percent in June
That still represents a significant runup in mortgage rates since January, when they averaged 7
