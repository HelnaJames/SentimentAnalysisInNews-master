However, the Russian leader seemed unready for concessions on the rebel demand for full autonomy
 His press service said he had empowered Lebed to hold talks aimed at a political accord defining Chechnya as an integral part of the Russian Federation.
Yeltsin blesses Lebed bid for Chechnya peace.
Russian security chief Alexander Lebed pressed on with his plan to bring peace to Chechnya on Friday, armed at last with the public blessing of President Boris Yeltsin and his permission to seek a political solution.
Yeltsin had earlier seemed to snub his Chechnya envoy on his plea for an early meeting, raising questions over how much authority Lebed really possessed as he strove for an end to the 20-month-long war.
Itar-Tass news agency reported that Lebed briefed Yeltsin late on Friday and the president gave the former paratroop general his approval to seek a political solution in talks with leaders of the Chechen separatist guerrillas.
