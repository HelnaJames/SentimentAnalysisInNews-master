YeltsinblessesLebedbid for Chechnya peace
Janet GuttsmanMOSCOW 1996-08-23Russian security chief Alexander Lebed pressed on with his plan to bring peace to Chechnya on Friday, armed at last with the public blessing of President Boris Yeltsin and his permission to seek a political solution
Yeltsin had earlier seemed tosnubhisChechnya envoyon his plea for an early meeting, raising questions over how much authority Lebed really possessed as he strove for an end to the 20-month-long war
Itar-Tass news agency reported that Lebed briefed Yeltsin late on Friday and the president gave the former paratroop general his approval to seek a political solution in talks with leaders of the Chechen separatist guerrillas
However, the Russian leaderseemed unreadyforconcessionson the rebel demand for full autonomy
His press service said he hadempoweredLebedto hold talks aimed at a political accord defining Chechnya as an integral part of the Russian Federation
Yeltsin's backing was seen as crucial for Lebed, a novice in Kremlin intrigue who has said he expects strong resistance to a deal some in Moscow might consider a national humiliation
Lebed has badly needed some clarification of Moscow's murky chain of command
A truce under a military agreement secured by Lebed was holding on Friday and Russian and rebel commanders discussed how to implement other aspects of the military deal
Lebed, who had signed the agreement with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov, is drafting the broader political agreement and was expected to return to the region this weekend
Lebed, who Yeltsin gave sweeping powers as his special adviser in the breakaway republic, had returned in triumph from talks with separatist leaders
"I'm in command here
 I have legitimate authority to fulfil the duties I have been charged with," Interfax news agency quoted him as saying on his return to Moscow early on Friday
He said he had agreed a truce with the separatists and a political deal -- the key sticking point in 20 months of fighting between Russian troops and Chechen rebels -- would be ready within two days
Grozny was relatively calm on Friday and both Russian soldiers and Chechen fighters said the ceasefire was holding
Defence and interior ministry troops are both based in the region, and cooperation between them leaves a lot to be desired
Earlier this week, military commanders set a Thursday deadline for residents to quit the Chechen capital Grozny, but Lebed said the threat had not been approved by the Russian leadership
The military in Chechnya, humiliated by an August 6 separatist raid which captured much of Grozny, wants to drive the fighters out at any cost
But Lebed, who made his name as peacemaker in Moldova's separatist Dnestr region in 1992, says the costly war must be brought to an end
 He has effectively staked his political career on a peaceful and swift outcome
Lebed has already demanded that Yeltsin sack interior minister Anatoly Kulikov, accusing him of bungling the campaign, but Yeltsin refused
Lebed's peace plan was being put into operation on Friday
Plans were being worked out to pull Russian troops out of southern regions of Chechnya and set up joint patrols of separatists and Russian soldiiers in the capital
The head of Russia's North Caucasus military district, which includes Chechnya, noted ceasefires had come and gone before
Yeltsin had earlier appeared to be dissatisfied with Lebed, saying on Thursday: "He always promised to solve the Chechnya problem if he had power
 Now he has power
 But unfortunately the results of his work are not yet obvious
""But we will not despair
 We will take the issue to the end," he added
The United States and the European Community have welcomed the ceasefire agreements
"We welcome this agreement


 We look forward to its implementation by both of the parties and hope it leads eventually to a political settlement to the Chechen crisis," U
S
 State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said
Lebed was named Yeltsin's security chief as a vote-winning move between the two rounds of the presidential election
Lebed had captured 15 percent of the first-round vote, taking third place behind Yeltsin and the communist runner-up
Yeltsin virtually disappeared from sight soon after the first round, prompting speculation that he was ill
Aides denied all the rumours and press spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told Izvestia the president was "lively and dynamic" on Thursday after a two-day break
Komsomolskaya Pravda said Yeltsin had gone fishing and boating and played billiards during his short vacation
