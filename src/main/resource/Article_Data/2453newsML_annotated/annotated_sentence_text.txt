Singapore exports surprise with 6.4 pct July rise.
Singapore non-oil domestic exports, confounding most expectations, bounced back in July, surging 6.4 percent after dropping 6.1 percent in June, the Trade Development Board (TDB) said on Tuesday.
Non-oil exports expanded to Singapore $7.28 billion (US$ 5.16 billion) in nominal terms.
The figures were completely out of line with forecasts by leading economists.
 A Reuters poll of eight economists had early predicted a nominal year-on-year fall of 1.7 percent.
Non-oil exports performed much better than expected.
