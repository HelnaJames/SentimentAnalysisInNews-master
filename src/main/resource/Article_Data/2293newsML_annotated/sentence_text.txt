Kansas City, Mo
-based Sprint, which has operated a big chunk of the Internet for American businesses since 1992, said it wouldoffer the service for freeto200,000 of its existing telephone customersuntil it is introduced widely in the fall
After that, consumers will be able to choose a flat rate of $19
95 a month for unlimited access, or $1
50 an hour with no minimum or maximum usage requirement, the nation's third-largest long-distance company said
"We've been in the Internet, in factprofitable and making money in the Internet business, longer than anybody," saidJim Dodd, vice president of Internet Access Services forSprint
Industry analysts said Sprint took its time getting into the consumer side of the Internet access business to avoid some of the service glitches that have hurt its larger rivals
"Some others got not very good press," said Bette Massick Colombo at Bear Stearns &amp; Co
 "The fact that they are taking their time is okay
 I don't think they've lost ground
"Sprint said the service, dubbed Sprint Internet Passport, will provide around-the-clock access to the global computer network with a local phone call in 212 cities to start, and in more than 300 cities by year-end
The offering compares with the services rolled out by AT&amp;T Corp
 and MCI Communications Corp
 as well as regional Bell operating companies earlier this year
AT&amp;T's entry into the market, which included some free access time, sparked a flurry of competition that sent shockwaves through the consumer Internet access business
Sprint's service initially will support only the Netscape Navigator search software, but Dodd said the company was taking with Microsoft about including its Explorer "browser" software as well
"In our first release we won't support the Microsoft browser, but we expect them to be a part of our service shortly," Dodd said
In 1992, Sprint became the first long-distance company to offer commercial Internet service, and now offers access to more than 1,000 Internet service providers and to a host of other businesses
 Sprint also provides on-line access for most major proprietary online services
Sprint has $12
8 billion in annual revenues and serves more than 15 million business and residential customers
It said its offerings would also include Netscape Navigator, a rebate certificate for a high-speed modem, access speeds of up to 14
4 and 28
8 kilobits per second, a dedicated Web site with e-mail, news, directory and search services, and technical support online or through a toll-free 800 number
Credit card billing will be offered
