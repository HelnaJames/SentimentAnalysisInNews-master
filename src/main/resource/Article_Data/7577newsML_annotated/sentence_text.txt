In contrast to industry, the construction sector remained in a downtrend in the second quarter, with any rebound due merely to seasonal factors, the ministry said
 Output has not returned to the levels of last autumn
"Construction has not fully recovered from its first-quarter fall," Grebe said
 "Builders have been more careful in resuming output
Exports saw a light upturn in the second quarter after stagnating in the preceding two quarters, the ministry said
 Exports to European Union countries rose weakly, but shipments to other countries rose more strongly
The labour market remained depressed, as economic growth forces remained too feeble to bring much relief
