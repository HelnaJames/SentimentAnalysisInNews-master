Bonn sees better second quarter growth.
Germany's economy shook itself out of a slump to grow about 1 percent in the second quarter from the year-earlier quarter, on the high side of private-sector expectations, the economics ministry said Thursday.
"Important economic indicators in Germany have improved perceptibly recently," the ministry said in a monthly report.
"Signs are increasing that the growth lull observed since mid-1995 has been overcome."
The ministry also said gross domestic product (GDP) grew clearly from the previous quarter, but it did not specify a figure.
Private forecasts, for example by the DIW research institute, see second-quarter growth at 0.5 percent from the previous quarter and 0.7 percent from the year-earlier quarter.
