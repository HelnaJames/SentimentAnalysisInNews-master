Japan's Hashimoto opens Brazil visit with tours.
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto arrived in Brazil on Saturday to boost trade with Latin America's biggest economy and reaffirm ties with the world's largest Japanese community outside Japan.
Hashimoto began his three-day official visit with a bit of sight-seeing, stopping first in Southern Brazil at the spectacular Iguazu Falls, where some 300 waterfalls cascade over a 1,000-foot (300 meter) wide precipice at the border with Argentina and Paraguay.
"He has wanted to see the falls for quite sometime," said a senior Japanese diplomat.
