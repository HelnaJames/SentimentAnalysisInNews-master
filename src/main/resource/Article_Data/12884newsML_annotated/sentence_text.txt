BA close to $4 billion Boeing order - paper
LONDON 1996-08-25TheSunday Times newspapersaid on Sunday that British Airways Plc was close to announcing an order for up to 30 Boeing Co
 aircraft worth nearly $4 billion
The order was mainly for 747-400 jumbo jets powered by engines produces by Rolls-Royce, the article added
A spokesman for BA declined to comment on the newspaper report
The paper noted that, despite BA's interest in buying 747-400s, theBritish carrierwasresistingsuggestions that it be a launch customer for Boeing's 747-600 super jumbowhich is due to be launched at next week's Farnborough, England airshow
According to the Sunday Times, one of BA's immediate areas of focus was the need to upgrade its fleet
More than half the 30 aircraft it planned to buy would be conversions of existing options into firm orders
The new planes would allow BA to use larger aircraft on many routes and to replace its ageing 747-100 jumbos powered by engines from Pratt and Witney, a unit of United Technologies Corp

The report said the notional value for Rolls-Royce of the engine order was about $1 billion but it was likely that BA would take the engines at a much keener price
The deal would, nevertheless, help secure thousands of jobs at Rolls-Royce's British plants
