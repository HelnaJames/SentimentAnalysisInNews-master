World oil prices fall sharply on profit-taking.
World oil prices took a hammering late on Friday largely on extended profit-taking in the London futures market ahead of a long holiday weekend, traders said.
London October futures for international benchmark Brent crude closed at $20.41 a barrel, down 31 cents on the day.
Earlier the contract traded close to four-month highs, propped up by rising demand for energy ahead of the northern hemisphere winter.
"It's extended profit-taking and weakness in the crude," a floor broker said.
