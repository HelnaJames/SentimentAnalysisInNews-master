Ecological warfare has broken out across the British construction industry, striking some of the biggest corporates as activists give up peaceful protests and seek to hit builders where it hurts -- their profit margins.
Described by one British company as "eco-terrorism", it is seen as the new business risk of the 1990s.
Famous names like Tarmac Plc, Costain Group Plc and ARC, a unit of conglomerate Hanson Plc, have all been targeted.
Activist groups are no longer seen by British firms as a harmless, badly organised ragbag of students and hippies.
"You only have to see them in action at protests," said David Harding, spokesman at ARC, Hanson's aggregates company.
