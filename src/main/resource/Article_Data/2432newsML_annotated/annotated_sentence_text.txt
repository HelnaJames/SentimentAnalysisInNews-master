China calls on TV makers to halt price cuts.
China is urging its colour television producers to end a price war, saying it is hurting the domestic industry and helping foreign brands, the Economic Daily said on Tuesday.
The price war -- touched off in March by industry giant Sichuan Changhong Electric Appliances Co ltd -- was an attempt to counter rampant smuggling of foreign TVs and rising domestic stockpiles, Liu Jianfeng, vice minister of the Ministry of Electronics Industry was quoted as saying.
Major companies in the domestic television market include Shenzhen Konka Electronics (Group) Co Ltd and Hong Kong-listed Nanjing Panda Electronics Co Ltd.
The price slashing has cut into earnings of domestic makers
