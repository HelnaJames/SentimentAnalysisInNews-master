Government departments in Guangzhou currently charged overseas-funded companies 228 kinds of fees, collecting 2
796 billion yuan ($337 million) a year -- more than three times the total in 1989, it said
Charges which had not been approved by the state or provincial governments would be cancelled, while some approved fees would be lowered, it said but gave no details
Although Guangzhou's economy has soared in recent years, buoyed by large-scale investment from overseas Chinese and from nearby Hong Kong, investment from multinationals and Western companies remained scarce, Xinhua said
Guangdong provincial leaders vowed last year to stamp out the widespread but reviled practice of local governments charging businesses arbitrary fees, which was blamed for damaging the investment climate and fuelling inflation
