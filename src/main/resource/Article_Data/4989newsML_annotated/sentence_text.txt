Cris ChinakaHARARE 1996-08-21Zimbabwean civil servantsdefiedon Wednesday agovernment order to end a rare strike over pay, leaving somecritical essential servicespartially paralysed
Tension roseamong the striking workers during the day amid rumours that somePublic Service Association (PSA) union leaders, including its influential executive secretary John Makoni, had beenarrestedby Zimbabwe's feared secret police
Police spokesmen were unavailable for immediate comment, but PSA officials said they were definite their colleagues were in police custody
Earlier,Makonihad told reporters that "many" of the southern African state's 180,000 civil servantswould continue the strikethat began on Tuesday and left only senior officials at work
"We have not changed our stance
Our position is still that we will only return to work once there is some commitment that the PSC (Public Services Commission) and ministry of public service, labour and social service will address our grievances,"hesaid
In the capital Harare, thousands of workers marched, sang and danced mostly around government offices and in a central city park, vowing only promises of higher pay would take them off the streets
 Dozens of police kept a wary eye on the crowd
Elsewhere around the country, state media reported that "many workers" were demonstrating, and that at least two provincial governors had been booed off the stage after attempts to persuade workers to return to work
The PSA called the strike to press demands for wage rises of around 30 percent and said increases of between three to eight percent recently awarded by the government were unacceptable
Local media reports said thousands of government employees were milling around their work places despite calls on Tuesday by Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro to report to work
Chitauro said the strike was illegal and those who did not return to work would be dismissed
State hospitals were handling only critical cases and offering rudimentary services in the general wards, using senior nurses, army medical personnel and the Red Cross nurses, with thousands of their own nurses out on strike
