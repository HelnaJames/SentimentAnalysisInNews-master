Zimbabwe strikers defy order to return to work.
Zimbabwean civil servants defied on Wednesday a government order to end a rare strike over pay, leaving some critical essential services partially paralysed.
Tension rose among the striking workers during the day amid rumours that some Public Service Association (PSA) union leaders, including its influential executive secretary John Makoni, had been arrested by Zimbabwe's feared secret police.
Police spokesmen were unavailable for immediate comment, but PSA officials said they were definite their colleagues were in police custody.
Earlier, Makoni had told reporters that "many" of the southern African state's 180,000 civil servants would continue the strike that began on Tuesday and left only senior officials at work.
"We have not changed our stance
 Our position is still that we will only return to work once there is some commitment that the PSC (Public Services Commission) and ministry of public service, labour and social service will address our grievances," he said.
