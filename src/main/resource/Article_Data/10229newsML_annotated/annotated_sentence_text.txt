Turkey says Shell LNG deal move shows confidence.
Turkish officials hailed on Friday a move by Royal Dutch/Shell Group to build a gas terminal and power plant complex worth $2.4 billion in Turkey as a return of foreign confidence to the country hit by political and economic instability over the past year.
"The Shell investment intention shows the level of confidence in Turkey from foreign investors," said a senior energy official, who declined to be named.
The Turkish arm of the Anglo-Dutch oil giant said on Friday it had applied to the energy ministry to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal and power plant complex that would have a total power capacity of 2,000 megaWatts (MW).
"We have expressed our intention to the energy ministry to build an LNG terminal and a power generation unit with a total capacity of 2,000 MW," a statement from the company said.
"The first power unit will be of 650 to 700 MW capacity," the statement said
