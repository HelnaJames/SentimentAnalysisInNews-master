China summons Ukraine ambassador in row over Taiwan.

China has summoned Ukraine's ambassador in Beijing Anatoly Plyushko to lodge a protest over a visit to Kiev by Taiwan's Vice President Lien Chan, an embassy spokesman said on Thursday.
"The Chinese expressed displeasure over this action in Ukraine that this person from Taiwan has got permission to visit the country," the spokesman said.
Chinese State Councillor Li Tieying, a member of the powerful Politburo of the ruling Communist Party, has also postponed a visit to Ukraine, the spokesman said.
Beijing has regarded Taiwan as a rebel province since the end of a civil war in 1949 and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation.
 The former Soviet republic of Ukraine recognises China and not Taiwan.
