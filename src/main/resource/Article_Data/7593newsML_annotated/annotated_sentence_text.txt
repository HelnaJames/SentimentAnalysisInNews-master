A reduction in a key German interest rate by the Bundesbank did little to move commodity prices on Thursday but it could help revive them in the third quarter, econmomists said.
Gold, the most closely related of the commodity markets, shrugged off the move in a very quiet trading day and the other markets were mainly involved in squaring their books ahead of a three-day holiday weekend in Britain and Hong Kong.
But a New York based economist noted the more accommodating monetary policy in Europe could stimulate industry and therefore demand for metals.
Others also noted that the U.S. Federal Reserve (central bank) was likely to leave rates unchanged until after the presidential election in November having left them unchanged after a policy committee meeting this week
