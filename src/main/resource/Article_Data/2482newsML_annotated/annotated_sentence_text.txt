Japanese kidnap victim says captivity was harrowing.
The Japanese electronics executive who was kidnapped in Mexico described his nine-day ordeal on Tuesday as harrowing and said he was looking forward to some rest and freedom.
Speaking for the first time since he was freed on Monday, Mamoru Konno told a news conference, "I plan now to rest and enjoy the company of my family and colleagues and savor the sweetness of freedom."
The 57-year-old president of a U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Sanyo Electric Co looked tired and fragile, and refused to say when he would return to work.
"It took a tremendous toll on me, physically, emotionally and intellectually, he told a news conference at Sanyo's San Diego facilities on Tuesday.
Konno was found in the basement of an unoccupied building in Tijuana, just south of the Mexican border, early on Monday morning.
