"The continuing growth in subscribers, the increase in the number of channels and the renewal of the Premier League (soccer) contract until 2001 provide a firm base from which to pioneer the development of digital television in the UK," chief executive Sam Chisholm said in a statement
"The agreement with Kirch Gruppe to develop the digital platform in Germany gives us a great opportunity to extend our business into continental Europe," he said
BSkyB plans to launch a British digital television service next year
Last month it signed a deal with the group headed by Bavarian media mogul Leo Kirch under which it will take a stake of up to 49 percent in DF1, Kirch's digital pay television operation
BSkyB is expected to inject 200 million pounds into the alliance to cover start-up losses over the next three years
 The deal gives BSkyB access to Europe's largest television market
BSkyB said spending on programming rose by 28 percent to 420 million pounds after the purchase of golf, boxing and cricket events and the launch of new channels such as Disney
The programming spend is set to rise further following a 670 million pound deal signed in June which will enable BSkyB to retain rights to broadcast live English Premier League soccer for the next five years
One cloud on the horizon is a report that British cable companies may seek European Commission intervention over the fees BSkyB charges for its top channels
The Financial Times said the cable companies fear they will not secure satisfactory conditions despite BSkyB undertakings to revise the structure of its wholesale rate card
