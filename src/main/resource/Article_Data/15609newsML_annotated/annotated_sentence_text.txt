Consolidated Freightways stock jumps on spin off.
The stock of Consolidated Freightways Inc. jumped in early trading Tuesday, one day after the transportation company said it plans to spin -off its long-haul, less-than-truckload units
Consolidated was up $2 to $23.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Palo Alto, Calif.-based firm said Monday that the spin-off was due to rapid change in the transportation business that recently caused some of its divisions to compete against each other for the same business.
Consolidated Freightways Inc., which has revenues of $5.7 billion, said it will spin off the new company, to be called Consolidated Freightways Corp., to stockholders in a tax-free transaction expected to close by the end of the year.
The units to be spun off have revenues of $2.1 billion
