Manufactured housing maker Champion to acquire Redman.
Champion Enterprises Inc. has a definitive agreement to acquire Redman Industries Inc., another major manufactured housing company, in a stock deal valued at about $365.5 million, they said Tuesday.
The deal would combine the second- and third-largest companies in the manufactured housing business, creating an entity that would rival Fleetwood Enterprises Inc. as the industry's leader.
Under the agreement, Champion will offer 1.24 shares of its stock for each of Dallas-based Redman's 13.36 million shares outstanding in a tax-free pooling of interests.
Auburn Hills, Mich.-based Champion said it would issue about 17 million shares in the merger and would have 51 million shares outstanding after the deal.
Redman's stock was unchanged at $25.75 on Nasdaq, while Champion edged down 12.5 cents to $21.50 on the New York Stock Exchange at mid-morning.
