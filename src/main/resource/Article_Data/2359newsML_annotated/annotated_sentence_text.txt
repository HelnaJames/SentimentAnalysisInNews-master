UK Investment Trust discounts stable end July - AITC.
Average discounts on UK investment trusts were stable at the end of July at 10.86 percent, slightly down from the June average of 10.94 percent, a statement from the Association of Investment Trust Companies (AITC) showed.
There was also evidence discounts could be narrowing again
 Figures from the Datastream Consortium List showed the average discount at nine percent on August 14, the AITC said.
Ernest Fenton, director general of the AITC noted that discounts are "often misunderstood by individual investors."
He said "Discounts are not an automatic indication of poor performance or poor returns on investments.
