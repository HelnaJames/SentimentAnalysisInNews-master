S.Korea Chun's lawyers study appeal against ruling.
A day after disgraced former president Chun Doo Hwan was sentenced to death on charges of mutiny and treason, his defence lawyers on Tuesday were studying ways to challenge the court ruling.
Neither Chun nor his presidential successor Roh Tae-woo, sentenced to 22-1/2 years in prison on similar charges stemming from a 1979 military coup and an army massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in the city of Kwangju the following year, have yet lodged formal appeals.
"The defence team is studying whether to appeal against the sentence," an aide to Lee Yang-woo, Chun's defence lawyer, said by telephone.
But media reports said lawyers of Chun and Roh were already preparing to challenge the rulings and that the appeals could drag through the courts for up to eight months
The lawyers were not immediately available for comment.
