Turkey pins hopes on nuclear energy, natural gas.

Power-hungry Turkey, facing energy shortages later this year, has pinned its hopes on natural gas from Iran and development of its first nuclear power plant to meet its long-term energy needs.
Recai Kutan, energy minister of the Islamist coalition government that struck a multi-billion dollar gas supply deal with Iran last week, said power generation from nuclear energy was inevitable despite environmentalist concerns.
"Nuclear power is a must for Turkey," he told a meeting of businessmen in the western city of Izmit.
We cannot build big hydroenergy power plants every year
 We must make use of our nuclear energy potential," he said in remarks carried by Anatolian news agency.
