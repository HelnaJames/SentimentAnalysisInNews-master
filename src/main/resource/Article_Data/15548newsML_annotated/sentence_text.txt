DALLASFoxMeyer Drug Co
, the nation's fourth-largest wholesaler of drugs, said Tuesday itfiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protectionafterefforts to sell the ailing companyfell through
FoxMeyer Health Corp
 said last week that it was in final negotiations to sell FoxMeyer Drug to a New Jersey investor group led by William Taggart, a turnaround expert, for $25 million in cash and securities
The subsidiary accounts for most of FoxMeyer Health's $5
5 billion in annual revenue
Melvin Esterin, co-chairman of FoxMeyer, said the company sought a buyer to raise new capital, but thesalewascalled offbecause its suppliersrefused to workwith the Taggart group
"I can't tell you the rationale for their decision," he said
The bankruptcy was triggered by FoxMeyer Health's announcement last week that it lost $288
4 million, or $17
27 a share, on revenues of 4 million in the first quarter
 The results include a write-down of investment in FoxMeyer Drug of $238
7 million
"Our suppliers reduced credit availability" for fear that they might not be paid, Esterin said
 As a result, FoxMeyer Drug's payables tumbled from $606 million as of June 30 to $480 million Monday, he said
FoxMeyer Drug also announced the appointment of Robert Peiser as the drug unit's vice chairman and chief executive
Peiser is the former chief financial officer of Trans World Air Lines and is widely credited with being the architect of that company's restructuring, said Michael Kolbenschlag, a spokesman for FoxMeyer Health
The company also secured a $775 million financing package arranged by GE Capital Services as part of the bankruptcy filing, under which it will reorganize its finances
FoxMeyer Drug said that, although it was able to reach an agreement in June on a new and expanded credit package, recent restrictions on the terms by its suppliers forced it to file for bankruptcy
"As we explained in several meetings with a number of our suppliers, we believe that we would have been able to operate successfully outside of Chapter 11 with the continuation of normal trade terms," said William Estes, president and chief operating officer of FoxMeyer Drug
"Some suppliers, however, apparently preferred the certainty of a Chapter 11, where they knew that as post-petition suppliers they would receive priority status by the court for any new goods that were purchased," he said
The Dallas-based company said FoxMeyer Drug will operate as usual despite the bankruptcy filing
 The action does not affect the parent company
But FoxMeyer's other subsidiaries also declared bankruptcy
 These are Foxmeyer Corp
 and its units, Healthcare Transportation System Inc
, Foxmeyer Drug Co
, Merchandise Coordinator Services Corp
, Foxmeyer Software Inc
 and Healthmart Inc
The company also faces a class-action lawsuit that charges that FoxMeyer and certain of its officers and directors violated securities laws
FoxMeyer's stock slid 37
5 cents to $3
75 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, extending the previous day's slide
On Monday, FoxMeyer declined the NYSE's request that the company make a public statement indicating whether there were any corporate developments that might explain its stock activity, the exchange said
