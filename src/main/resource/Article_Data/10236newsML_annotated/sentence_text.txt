Oil MinisterDan Etetetold executives of the major companies in Lagos late on Thursday that rules would be strictly enforced to redress the perceived imbalance
"Thegovernment and people of Nigeriaare not getting their fair shareout of the joint venture arrangements for petroleum exploration and production,"hesaid
"Inequalities and anomalieswhichhave almost madeNigeriathe laughing stockof the international petroleum industry have to be eliminated
"Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, relies on the two million barrels of crude oil it pumps every day for about 95 percent of export earnings
Etete said the joint ventures would have to set up escrow accounts, allowing the government to keep a closer eye on where contributions to production and exploration costs were going
One company official said on Friday: "We are still trying to work out what it really means
 It may be a matter of rhetoric, or it may be that the minister has definite plans worked out
An official at another company said: "We already have extensive vetting


there is no need for any more
 It would inevitably increase costs


It would hurt the joint ventures, in which Nigeria has the largest share
"State-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corp is majority partner in ventures with subsidiaries of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp, Agip SpA and Elf Aquitaine
To increase Nigerian participation in the industry, Etete said oil industry contracts would have to be handed out to locally registered companies
 He bemoaned the loss of tax revenues to foreign-employed oil service companies
Etete said that joint venture partners would have to recruit Nigerian staff wherever possible in preference to foreigners
"No wages shall be sanctioned in the case of any expatriate whose engagement did not meet with


prior approval," he said
Heavily indebted Nigeria has yet to emerge from an economic quagmire since a wave of strikes and protests in 1994, which followed the annulment of presidential elections in 1993 that would have ended 10 years of army rule
Etete said the government planned to open up marginal fields inside the main oil companies' concessions and hand them over to those who are "seriously interested in exploiting them"
Marginal fields are believed to hold reserves of 800 million barrels of a total Nigerian reserve above 21 billion barrels
Delays in cash-call payments have often provoked the ire of the oil companies in the past, and this year government has cut by 30 percent its initial budget provision of $2 billion for oil operations, a decision challenged by the companies
Negotiators for the two sides are trying to hammer out new rules for joint venture operations
Analysts say budget cuts make it unlikely that Nigeria will reach its turn-of-the-century output capacity target of 2
5 million barrels a day
 The government is under severe pressure from a $32 billion foreign debt to keep spending under control
