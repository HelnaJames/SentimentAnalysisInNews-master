McDonald's Corp
 andMcDonald's South Africasaid the appeals courtconfirmed them as rightful ownersof all McDonald's trademarks currently registered in South Africa
Since last year, the group has beeninvolved in a lengthy battleto prevent local rivals, businessmen George Sombonos and George Charalambous, from using its name
McDonald's, which stayed away from South Africa during apartheid, opened its first fast-food outlet in the country last year and now has seven, most owned by local entrepreneurs
A court had earlier ruled in favour of the two Georges, whorejectedthe U
S
 corporation's claimthat U

 sanctions had kept it out of apartheid South Africa
The businessmen argued that McDonald's had let its right to the trademarks under South African law lapse by registering them but failing to use them over the ensuing five years
McDonald's is the largest global food retailer, with over 19,200 outlets in 94 countries
 Nearly three-quarters are franchised
South Africans love fast-food and the hamburger chain faces stiff entrenched competition from local rivals with names such as Bimbo's and Chicken Licken
