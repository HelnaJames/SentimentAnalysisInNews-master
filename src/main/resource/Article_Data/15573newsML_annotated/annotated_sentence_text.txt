McDonald's wins S.African trademark case.
A South African court has ruled that only U.S. hamburger chain McDonald's can sell Big Macs, McNuggets, Fillet-o-Fish and its other trademarked fast foods, the company said Tuesday.

McDonald's Corp. and McDonald's South Africa said the appeals court confirmed them as rightful owners of all McDonald's trademarks currently registered in South Africa.
Since last year, the group has been involved in a lengthy battle to prevent local rivals, businessmen George Sombonos and George Charalambous, from using its name.
McDonald's, which stayed away from South Africa during apartheid, opened its first fast-food outlet in the country last year and now has seven, most owned by local entrepreneurs.
A court had earlier ruled in favour of the two Georges, who rejected the U.S. corporation's claim that U.S. sanctions had kept it out of apartheid South Africa.
