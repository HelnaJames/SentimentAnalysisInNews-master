Polish consumer group takes Coca-Cola to court.
Poland's Consumer Federation has issued four court writs against Coca-Cola's local unit seeking payment on behalf of people who say they won prizes in a promotion this year, PAP news agency said on Tuesday.
In the promotion launched by Coca-Cola Poland Services Sp. z.o.o., customers who submitted two bottle tops printed on the inside with matching dates and venues for past Olympic Games, plus the same sum of money, could win cash prizes.
Four consumers say the firm did not pay out when they submitted such matching caps and have sought the consumer group's support, the Polish news agency reported.
The demands for payment before the Warsaw provincial court total 320,000 zlotys ($116,000), it added.
Coca-Cola spokesman Marcin Barcz told Reuters the claims arose because on some caps the number eight had been badly printed and could be taken to look like a six, arousing some false hopes.
