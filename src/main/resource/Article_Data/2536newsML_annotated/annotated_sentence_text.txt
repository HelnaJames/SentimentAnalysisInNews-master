Fed seen holding U.S. interest rates steady.
The U.S. Federal Reserve meets on Tuesday to discuss the future course of interest rates and is widely expected to keep rates steady amid mixed signals on the economy.
"The speeches made by various Fed governors and by bank presidents recently are not pointing toward tightening," said Preston Martin, chairman of HomeVest Financial Services Inc. in San Francisco.
"I would think the odds are very heavily weighted toward the prospect that there will be no change at the next policy making meeting," said Martin, a former Fed vice chairman.
The Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee is due to start meeting at 9 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT).
If past practice is followed, any decision by the FOMC should be announced around 2:15 p.m. EDT (1815 GMT).
