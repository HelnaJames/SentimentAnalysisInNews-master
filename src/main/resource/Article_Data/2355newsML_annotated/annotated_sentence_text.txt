It had eased a bit as dealers took their profits in early European business after reaching a peak of $5.26 overnight.
But several dealers said they saw it venturing higher later this week.
 "There has seen some good hedge-fund buying of silver call options, and also the underlying (silver metal) recently," a dealer said.
Silver fixes at two-month high, but gold lags.
Silver fixed at its highest level since June 19, 1996 on Tuesday morning following buying by speculators late on Monday in New York.
Silver fixed at $5.2025 an ounce, up 12 cents from Monday's fix and eight cents above Monday's London close.
