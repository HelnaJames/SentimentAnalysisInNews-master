CRICKET-ANWAR KEEPS PAKISTAN ON TOP.
Pakistan tightened the screws on England on the third day of the final test at The Oval on Saturday as opener Saeed Anwar moved relentlessly towards the first double century of his test career.
Adopting a more restrained approach than on the previous evening, the Pakistanis added another 89 runs in the morning session to reach 318 for two at lunch, a deficit of just eight runs
 Anwar was unbeaten on 169 and Inzamam-ul-Haq 30 not out.
The left-hander has already equalled his previous test best against New Zealand in Wellington in 1993-94 and looks well capable of becoming the sixth Pakistan batsman to score a double hundred against England.
England's bowlers did at least find a better line in the first hour, conceding only 25 runs and removing the prolific Ijaz Ahmed for 61.
The Pakistan number three, who has failed to pass 50 just once in the series, had added three to his overnight score when he edged a widish delivery from Alan Mullally to Alec Stewart behind the stumps.
