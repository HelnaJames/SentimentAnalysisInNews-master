Robert KitsonLONDON 1996-08-24Pakistantightened the screwsonEnglandon the third day of the final test at The Oval on Saturday as opener Saeed Anwar moved relentlessly towards the first double century of his test career
Adopting a more restrained approach than on the previous evening, the Pakistanis added another 89 runs in the morning session to reach 318 for two at lunch, a deficit of just eight runs
Anwar was unbeaten on 169 and Inzamam-ul-Haq 30 not out
The left-hander has already equalled his previous test best against New Zealand in Wellington in 1993-94 andlooks well capableof becoming the sixth Pakistan batsman to score a double hundred against England
England's bowlers did at least find a better line in the first hour, conceding only 25 runs and removing the prolific Ijaz Ahmed for 61
The Pakistan number three, who has failed to pass 50 just once in the series, had added three to his overnight score when he edged a widish delivery from Alan Mullally to Alec Stewart behind the stumps
Inzamam, a century-maker at Lord's in the first test, was content to play himself in until the shackles were broken by the re-introduction of leg-spinner Ian Salisbury, enduring a dismal return to test cricket
His first three balls of the day to Anwar cost 10 runs and he earned an ironic cheer from the crowd when he finally delivered his first dot ball
Captain Mike Atherton was forced to withdraw him from the attack after just three overs, opting instead to hand Dominic Cork and Chris Lewis the second new ball
Neither could make a breakthrough as the pitch continued to offer scant assistance and a frustrated Cork was guilty of some ill-judged petulance when he shoved Anwar aside at the bowlers' end
