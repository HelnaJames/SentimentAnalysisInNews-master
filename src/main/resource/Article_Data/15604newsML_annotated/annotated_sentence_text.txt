Roche first half-profit rises 16 percent.
Swiss pharmaceuticals group Roche Holding AG said Tuesday its first-half net profit rose a healthy 16 percent and forecast higher profits for the full year, but analysts and markets were slightly disappointed with its operating performance.
Roche attributed the rise in first half profit to 2.2 billion francs ($1.85 billion) from 1.9 billion ($1.6 billion) to better operating results and the performance of its financial operations.
Analysts on average had forecast that Roche would show a 17 percent increase in net profit for the first half.
"The results look fine but I would have liked a little more," said Peter McDougall of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.
Roche's first-half operating profits rose 8.0 percent to 1.9 billion francs ($1.6 billion), despite growing pressure on prices in major markets.
