Netscape agrees to support Apple technology.
Netscape Communications Corp. gave a boost Tuesday to Apple Computer Inc.'s efforts to make the Internet a key element in its turnaround strategy.
The two companies said Netscape had agreed to develop a new version of its Netscape Navigator Internet browser that supports Apple's Cyberdog Internet search software as well as OpenDoc, software backed by Apple for manipulating documents.
Apple will distribute Netscape Navigator for Cyberdog with its Mac operating system and plans to incorporate the browser in future versions of its Mac system for Apple computers.
Cyberdog allows Internet sufers to navigate by clicking on icons, for example, while Opendoc allows people to mix and match software combining text, graphics and video from different systems.
Analysts said the move underscores Apple's commitment to developing Internet technologies and extends the relationship between the two companies at a time when they are both facing extreme competitive pressure.
