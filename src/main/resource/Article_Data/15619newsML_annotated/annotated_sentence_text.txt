Consolidated Freightways to spin off units.
Transportation company Consolidated Freightways Inc. said Monday it plans to spin part of its long-haul trucking operations into a separate company.
Consolidated said the move was due to changes in the transportation business that recently caused Consolidated units to bid against each other for the same business.
"It has become clear that significant changes in our traditional trucking markets have occurred throughout the freight transportation industry," said Chairman David Moffitt.
"These changes, which have been especially dramatic in the past 18 months, have increasingly placed our separate and distinct regional and national trucking companies in a position where they are in direct competition with each other," he said in a statement.
Moffitt said the two companies would be more competitive as independent companies.
Industry analysts have expected Consolidated to attempt to spin-off or sell CF MotorFreight as the industry for less-than-truckload shippers has seen increased competition, flat yields and an overcapacity of trucks.
