USA: Consolidated Freightways to spin off units
Consolidated Freightways to spin off units
Mark EganPALO ALTO, Calif
Transportation companyConsolidated Freightways Inc
said Monday it plans to spin part of its long-haul trucking operations into a separate company
Consolidatedsaid the move was due to changes in the transportation business that recently caused Consolidated units tobid against each other for the same business
"It has become clear that significant changes in our traditional trucking markets have occurred throughout the freight transportation industry," saidChairman David Moffitt
"These changes, which have been especially dramatic in the past 18 months, have increasingly placed our separate and distinct regional and national trucking companies in a position where they are in direct competition with each other,"hesaid in a statement
Moffittsaid the two companies would be more competitive as independent companies
Industry analysts have expected Consolidated to attempt to spin-off or sell CF MotorFreight as the industry for less-than-truckload shippers has seen increased competition, flat yields and an overcapacity of trucks
CF MotorFreight lost money in the fourth quarter of last year as well as the first two quarters of this year
 The move to spin-off the business comes just months after the unit has managed to return a profit
"They were profitable in June and have been pretty much break-even since then," said Mark Nelson, spokesman for Consolidated
 "For the first couple of quarters this year and in the fourth quarter they were losing money
""This is something that's been analysed internally and it makes good sense for both companies," he added
Consolidated, with annual sales of $5
7 billion, said it will spin-off the new company, to be called  Consolidated Freightways Corp
, to shareholders in a tax-free transaction expected to close by the end of the year
The units to be spun off have revenues of about $2
1 billion and include CF MotorFreight and its Canadian operations, including Canadian Freightways Ltd
, Epic Express, Milne &amp; Craighead and Canadian Sufferance Warehouses
The new company will be virtually debt-free, the company said
Consolidated Freightways Inc
 will change its name to CNF Transportation Inc
 and will include Emery Worldwide, Con-Way Transportation Services, Con-Way Truckload Services, Menlo Logistics, Road Systems Inc
 and VantageParts
After the spin-off CNF Transportation Inc
 will have debt of about $450 million, increasing its debt to equity ratio from about 46 percent to 54 percent, Nelson said
Consolidated will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange and will file for a listing for the new company
Donald Moffitt will head up CNF Transportation, while W
 Roger Curry, president and chief executive officer of CF MotorFreight, will head the new Consolidated Freightways Corp
Shares of Consolidated rose 50 cents to $21
875 on the New York Stock Exchange
 The announcement came after the close of trading
