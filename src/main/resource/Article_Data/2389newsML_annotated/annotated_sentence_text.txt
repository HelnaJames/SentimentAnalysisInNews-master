The CAW said the workers were concerned about job security and wanted an improved pension plan.
"Job security is a critical issue. We need protection with regard to outsourcing and respect for the fundamental principle of seniority is essential," he added.

The Canadian Auto Workers union said 400 members of its Local 1996 employed by Quaker Oats in Peterborough, Ontario, went on strike Tuesday.
"The company wants the right to lay off workers without regard to seniority," CAW national representative Jerry Dias said in a statement.
