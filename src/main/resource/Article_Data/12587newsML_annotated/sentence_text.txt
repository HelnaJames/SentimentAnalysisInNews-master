"It was agood match for me and a good win," saidSanchezVicarioof the 73-minute victory
"Everything worked reallywell for me today
 I was very happy with the way I played
 I'mlooking good and it's nice to be able to be in thesemifinals
"The scrappy Spaniard needed a decisive service break inthe final game to claim the opening set
 A lone break in theeighth game of the second moved this year's French Open,Wimbledon and Olympic runnerup into her 10th semi of the year
The second-ranked Spaniard now must focus on playingNovotna, with whom she has teamed to win 15 doubles titles
The Czech star publicly lashed out at Sanchez Vicario, sayingshe questioned too many line calls during a semifinal loss inthe recent Summer Olympic Games
"I'm not agreeing with anything she said," the Olympicsilver medalist explained
 "It hurt me a lot because there arethings you can say and things you cannot say
"But it doesn't matter because I play her three times thisyear and I beat her
 It happens sometimes you have to playyour doubles partner
 I have nothing against her but I don'tthink it was fair because it's not true
"Though the two have talked and are committed to play atthe upcoming U
S
 Open and the Corel WTA Championship inNovember, Sanchez Vicario is still not happy with the wayNovotna handled herself in front of the media
 "If she hadsomething to say, she should have come to me
 I don't think itwas very smart
"Novota didn't play smart in the opening set but managed toprevail against the world's No
 40 ranked player
"I didn't expect Sandrine Testud to play so well," saidNovotna, who improved to 4-0 against the French player
 "Itold her after the match she deserves all the credit becauseshe played unbelievable
 She ran down so many of my balls, andI happened to be a little more aggressive and a little luckierat the end to win the whole match
 But I thought it was areally unbelievable match
"Testud sailed through the opening set with pinpointpassing shots against Novotna's aggressive net-rushing style
The second set went into a tiebreaker and the Frenchplayer led 4-2 before committing five straight errors
Novotna led 4-3 in the decisive third set and used a loneservice break in the next game when at break point she laced abackhand pass before closing out the come-from-behind victory
"I thought towards the end it was my serve and forehand,especially when I was down in the tiebreaker," Novotna said
"She wasn't really aggressive enough
 She was hoping I wouldmake all the mistakes
 But I happened to play some very goodshots and that was the turnover
"Date played a smart baseline match against the lethargicArgentine, who committed seven costly double faults, includingfour at break point
"I've played her several times in the past, but I think ifI had to compare her where she was in the Top 10, she's makingmore unforced errors and looks like she wasn't able to putmuch pressure on me by her serve," said Date, who improved hercareer mark to 3-4 against Sabatini
 "I would say, she was notin good form today
