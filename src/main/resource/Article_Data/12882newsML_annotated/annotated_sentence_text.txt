Bonn suggests compromise in EU row over VW funds.
German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt has suggested temporarily freezing controversial east German subsidies to car giant Volkswagen AG to help settle a row with the European Commission.
The Commission is disputing the legality of 91 million marks ($61.09 million) of a 142-million-mark subsidy package paid to Volkswagen to support its investment in two plants in the east German state of Saxony
In an interview to be published in this week's Der Spiegel magazine, Rexrodt said he supported Volkswagen's case but said a temporary freeze of the disputed funds pending a European court ruling could form the basis for compromise
"But that will not work without the support of the receiver of the payment
VW has not yet warmed to an idea like this," Rexrodt cautioned.
