Bonn suggests compromise in EU row over VW funds
Catherine O'MahonyFRANKFURT 1996-08-25German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt has suggested temporarily freezing controversial east German subsidies to car giant Volkswagen AG to help settle a row with the European Commission
The Commission isdisputingthe legality of 91 million marks($61
09 million) of a 142-million-mark subsidy package paid to Volkswagen to support its investment in two plants in the east German state of Saxony
In an interview to be published in this week's Der Spiegel magazine,Rexrodtsaid he supported Volkswagen's case but said a temporary freeze of the disputed funds pending a European court ruling could form the basis for compromise
"But that will not work without the support of the receiver of the payment
VW has not yet warmed to an idea like this," Rexrodt cautioned
The Saxony state government, which made the payment to Volkswagen in defiance of objections from Brussels, said on Sunday it had lodged a complaint against the Commission with the European Court of Justice before the weekend
A spokeswoman for the state said Saxony, with Bonn's support, wanted a court decision on whether Brussels had a legal say in determining the allocation of east German subsidies
A European ruling in June cleared only 540 million marks in East German subsidies for Volkswagen out of an initial plan for 780 million marks
In an interview published in the Financial Times' weekend edition, Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Piech insisted that the funds received in July were paid legally
Piech said: "We received it (the investment) legally and because we did so, we will invest it correctly
 We had the choice of any location: without support, it would not have been this one
"Rexrodt, who discussed the dispute with European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert on Friday but failed to reach a solution, said he believed the subsidy payment was justified, but "problematic and politically 


 dubious
"Separately, Saxony's Biedenkopf told German magazine Super Illu that he would not bend on the subsidy payment, on which he said 23,000 jobs depended
Volkswagen had threatened to pull the plug on its plans to build plants in the Saxony towns of Mosel and Chemnitz if the funds were not paid in full
"We will fight through this," said Biedenkopf
The Commission is due to discuss the case on September 4
 Meanwhile Bonn and the Commission are to continue their talks
