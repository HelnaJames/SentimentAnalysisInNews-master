LONDON 1996-08-23Precious metals prices hovered near the top of recent ranges on Friday butsummer lethargy should preventthembreaking higher in the near term,dealerssaid
"Gold's been in a narrow range and I don't think anyone sees it moving up in the next few days," one dealer said, adding that Monday's market holiday in Britain and Hong Kong would also slow trading
Gold bullion closed at $387
50 an ounce, compared to $386
95 on Thursday
 Some analysts predicted that if support at $386 held, gold could test the $388 and $390 levels next week
Gold and silver popped a little higher on Thursday afternoon in a burst of buying by investment funds in New York
 But neither metal made much progress and quickly came off highs
Their rise followed the German Bundesbank's cut in a key money market rate
 Some analysts said an easier global monetary policy might eventually encourage demand for precious metals
But most dealers agreed that, at least immediately, gold had ignored the rate cut
 "I don't think it's had any effect on the precious metals," one said
Gold was also unruffled by strong U
S
 July durable goods data on Friday which jolted bond and share markets
Silver finished steady at $5
23 an ounce, unchanged from Thursday's London close
Like gold, it was expected to remain range-bound after failing to conquer key resistance at $5
25 on Thursday
But silver's rally at the start of the week, which took it well above previous resistance around $5
15, was keeping the market slightly on edge
"The market is a little nervous," a dealer said
 "It's high enough to have to come back
 There's a slimmer chance of it going up but if we break through $5
27, we'll see $5
35
"Platinum closed a touch firmer at $399
50, while its sister metal palladium firmed by $1
