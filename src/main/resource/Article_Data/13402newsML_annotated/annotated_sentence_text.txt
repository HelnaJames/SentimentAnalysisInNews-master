Seoul court hands death to Chun, 22 years to Roh
A South Korean court sentenced former president Chun Doo Hwan to death on Monday on charges relating to a 1979 coup that thrust him to power.
His presidential successor, Roh Tae-woo, was sentenced to 22-1/2 years in prison on similar charges of masterminding the putsch and attempted murder of superior officers.
At the time both men were army generals.
However, Chun was cleared of a separate charge of murder in connection with an army massacre in 1980 of pro-democracy protesters in the southern city of Kwangju
Both were found guilty of taking bribes
