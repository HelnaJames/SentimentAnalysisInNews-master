S
 giant General Motors, has set up an office in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, theChina Daily newspapersaid on Saturday
Opel was trying to take advantage of the undeveloped automobile industry in Guangzhou and would focus on seeking opportunities to produce vehicles and components in the booming south, the newspaper quoted company officials as saying
Pressure was mountingonFrench car maker PSA Peugot Citroen Group's joint venturein the city, wherecar outputhadlaggedfar behind China's other main cities,itsaid
"People are playing close attention to Guangzhou to see who will succeed in persuading Peugot to give up its interest in the venture," it said
The Guangzhou Peugeot Automobile Co, which went into production in 1986, was able to produce and sell only several thousand cars a year, it said
The China Daily said Guangzhou's car industry had also been criticised for over-use of foreign components and for designs that were outdated in comparison with those made in Beijing, Shanghai and northern Tianjin city
But Opel and other foreign car makers were planning to revitalise the industry and turn the city into an automobile manufacturing centre, it said
China has one of the lowest vehicle density rates in the world, roughly one car per 700 people, and the car population is forecast to double to 20 million by the year 2000
