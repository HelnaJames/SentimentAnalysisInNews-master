Hundreds of armed police were deployed at Stansted airport, where the Sudanese Airways Airbus, orginally routed from Khartoum to Amman, landed in the early hours after being forced to divert to Cyprus for refueling
 At Larnaca the hijackers had at one point threatened to blow up the jet
Some police stood as close as 50 metres (yards) from the aircraft, while dozens of police vans waited about 1
5 miles (two km) across the tarmac along with firefighters and ambulances
Meanwhile, negotiations were conducted by radio after an Iraqi exile group said the hostage-takers wanted to contact one of its members
The hijackers, who said they want to seek asylum in Britain, were believed to have been armed with grenades and possibly other explosives, according to police
An official at the Iraqi Community Association said they believed the hijackers were trying to contact an Iraqi named Sadik Sadah
Sadah is a former member of the Association's executive committee who now works as a volunteer
 It was unclear whether Sadah made contact with the hijackers
Police were unable to comment on speculation that the Iraqis were diplomats based in Khartoum who were seeking to defect rather than return to Baghdad
The plane was hijacked on Monday evening soon after it left Khartoum for the Jordanian capital Amman
The hijackers started to release captives about two hours after the Airbus 310 airliner arrived at Stansted from Larnaca, where it was refuelled, at 4

 (0330 GMT)
Police said the passengers who disembarked, led by the elderly and mothers with small children, were very calm despite their ordeal
Two sick passengers were taken away in ambulances, but police said their illnesses were not related to the way they had been treated by the hijackers
Sanctions imposed on the government of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein mean international flights do not land in Baghdad
 Travellers fly to Amman and proceed overland
Members of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's family defected to Jordan last year
 Iraqi news media reported in February that the two top-level defectors, who were Saddam's sons-in-law, were murdered by relatives days after returning home to a pardon from the Iraqi leader
