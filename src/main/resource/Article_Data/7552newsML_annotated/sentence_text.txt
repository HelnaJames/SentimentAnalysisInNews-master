LONDON 1996-08-22Planned strikes on London's underground railwaywerecalled offon Thursday after a union representing train driversagreedto apay and hours deal
Although London commuters will now be spared 24-hour strikes that had been scheduled for Friday and next Tuesday, the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) was still planning to stage a24-hour walkouton Friday againstseven train companies up and down Britain
The stoppage was expected tocrippletrain servicesat the start of a busy three-day holiday weekend
The main union representing London's underground drivers, Aslef, had already accepted the pay and hours package
Separately on Thursday, Britain's postal delivery workers staged the sixth in a series ofone-day strikes in protestatnew working arrangements drawn up by the Royal Mail
However, hopes of a settlement rose after the Communication Workers Union (CWU) sent a letter to managers asking for more talks
 The Royal Mail has declined previous offers of talks after the CWU executive threw out a deal accepted by its own negotiators, but a spokeswoman said it was considering the latest request
Industrial unrest has been on the rise in Britain in recent months after several years of relative calm
The number of working days lost to strikes in June was 228,000, the highest figure in six years but still a far cry from the 2
4 million days lost in the summer of 1989 in a series of rail and docks strikes
During the 1984 miners' strike, three million working days were lost in one month
Alan Johnson, general secretary of the CWU, blamed the new rash of strikes on growing job insecurity in both the public and private sectors
"People feel insecure
 Many of them are on short-term contracts and performance-based pay -- all ideas that were introduced during the 1980s and they have led to a situation where people do not feel tranquil in their employment
 And that leads to all kinds of tensions," he told Channel Four news
