Separately on Thursday, Britain's postal delivery workers staged the sixth in a series of one-day strikes in protest at new working arrangements drawn up by the Royal Mail.
London underground rail strikes called off.
Planned strikes on London's underground railway were called off on Thursday after a union representing train drivers agreed to a pay and hours deal.
Although London commuters will now be spared 24-hour strikes that had been scheduled for Friday and next Tuesday, the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) was still planning to stage a 24-hour walkout on Friday against seven train companies up and down Britain.
The stoppage was expected to cripple train services at the start of a busy three-day holiday weekend.
The main union representing London's underground drivers, Aslef, had already accepted the pay and hours package.
