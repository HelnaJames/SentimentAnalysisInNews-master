Against the backdrop of a thousand choristers chanting a wordless corporate hymn, Bombardier Inc. on Monday unveiled its Global Express business jet -- a luxury aircraft the transportation and aerospace giant says will fly faster and farther than any in its class.
The sleek 99.5-foot (30.33 meter) long, US$34 million boardroom with wings will be able to travel 6,500 nautical miles -- halfway around the world -- without hitting the gas pumps and will be capable of reaching a top speed of 0.88 mach.
If it were configured like a commercial passenger jet, it would hold 50 passengers.
 But the luxurious appointments and boardroom in the sky mean the jet can only carry eight favoured business people and four crew members.
While Bombardier admits it is making a hefty bet on the specialised high-end executive jet market niche, it is sharing the risk with several global partners.
