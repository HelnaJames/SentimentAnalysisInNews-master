 French schools re-starts next week
Tuesday's meeting kicks off a series opposing Prime Minister Alain Juppe's budget, which is expected to axe between 2,000 and 2,500 teachers' jobs -- the first teaching cuts in 15 years -- under a plan to shed 6,500-7,000 civil service jobs
Juppe has said the 1997 budget would freeze spending at 1996 levels, implying a spending cut of 60 billion francs ($11
89 billion), to reduce the state deficit to three percent of gross domestic product in order to join the single European currency in 1999
"There will be tension and conflicts when people go back to work," Notat told the daily Le Monde, citing anger among staff at ailing property lender Credit Foncier, state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais, film studio SFP and appliance maker Moulinex
The CFDT would take part in union action, she said
 The Socialist-led CFDT, France's biggest union with some 650,000 members, is expected to announce its plans on September 27
Credit Foncier is being gradually wound down after making a 1995 net loss of 10
8 billion francs, while Credit Lyonnais is shedding jobs in a bid to make good losses totalling 21 billion francs racked up between 1992 and 1994
Some 667 jobs could go out of a total 1,056 at SFP if sold to businessman Walter Butler, while Moulinex is axing posts as part of a recovery plan
Former conservative prime minister Edouard Balladur, also in Le Monde, said France was suffering from a "lingering decline" and called for big cuts in income tax, local taxes and value added tax to boost consumer demand
 Reducing government spending was necessary but not sufficient, he said
Communist Party leader Robert Hue said on Monday the spirit of public sector strikes which brought France to a virtual standstill for 24 days in November and December last year was "still alive in the hearts and minds" of the French people
The Communist-led CGT union will unveil on Wednesday its plans to mobilise opposition to the budget, which is due to be discussed in cabinet around September 10, along with proposals for tax and social security reform
The executive committee of the Force Ouvriere union will meet on September 3 and is expected to draw up its oppostion plans, a spokesman said
