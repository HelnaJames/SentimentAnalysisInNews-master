Thecarrier, which is partially owned by the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark, saidgroup operating revenuefellto 17
44 billion Swedish crowns ($2
6 billion) from 17
74 billion ($2
7 billion)
A statement said an earlier forecast of somewhatweaker full-year incomebefore the sale of fixed assets compared with 1995 remainedunchanged
"Last year was a record year," SAS Chief Executive Officer Jan Stenberg told reporters
 "We cannot all the time continue to beat new world records
 Our profitability is very good compared to the rest of the European airline industry
"Full-year 1995 pre-tax profits were 2
63 billion Swedish crowns ($398 million)
Operating income in the second 1996 quarter fell mainly because a stronger Swedish crown had a negative effect on revenues in foreign currency not fully compensated for by positive effects on expenses in foreign currencies
"Part of the profit increase we would otherwise have seen we won't see because tickets sold in dollars and French franc are worth less in Swedish crowns," Stenberg said
The Swedish crown has strengthened by six percent since the beginning of the year while the trend in the first half of 1995 was a weaking of eight percent
After enjoying a virtual monopoly in Scandinavian skies for 50 years, SAS is now being challenged on its home base
 Several airlines have recently moved into the skies traditionally dominated by SAS, undercutting its passenger prices which remain some of the highest in the world
Virgin Express, run by Britain's high-flying entrepreneur Richard Branson, has announced the start of daily cheap flights between Copenhagen and Brussels from September
 Norwegian airline Braathens SAFE has been given approval to run up to nine daily flights between Oslo and Stockholm from this autumn -- a route once tightly controlled by SAS
