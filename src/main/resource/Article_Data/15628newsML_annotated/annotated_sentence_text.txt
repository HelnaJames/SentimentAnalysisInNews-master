United News to sell some local newspapers.
United News &amp; Media said its regional newspaper division had decided to divest its newspaper holdings in Wales and the South East of England. 
United News said the decision was prompted by the desire to focus on its primary areas in the north of England.
"The proposed divestment will allow us to concentrate on and develop our local media interests in the North, where we already have a strong portfolio of titles," said United News chief executive Clive Hollick.
United Provincial Newspapers (UPN), the UK regional newspaper division of United News, is the third largest regional publisher in the UK.
It had operating profits of 28.6 million stg in 1995 on revenue of 184.4 million stg, the bulk of which was generated from its northern titles.
