Bonn has led efforts to ensure consumer protection tops the list of priorities in dealing with the mad cow crisis, which erupted in March when Britain acknowledged humans could contract a similar illness by eating contaminated beef.
Bonn warns consumers to avoid British mutton.
Germany's Agriculture Ministry suggested on Wednesday that consumers avoid eating meat from British sheep until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to the animals.
"Until this is cleared up by the European Union's scientific panels -- and we have asked this to be done as quickly as possible -- (consumers) should if at all possible give preference to sheepmeat from other countries," ministry official Werner Zwingmann told ZDF television.
"I do not want to say that there is a concrete danger for consumers," he added
 "There are too many holes in what we know, and these must be filled very quickly."
