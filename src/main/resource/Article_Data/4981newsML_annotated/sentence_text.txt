CAMDEN, N
J
Campbell Soup Co
 is planning to cut its headquarters staff of 1,500, shut one of four major soup plants and divest some brand names, including Swanson frozen foods, thePhiladelphia Inquirerreported Wednesday
A Campbell spokesman called the newspaper report speculative but did not deny it, which cited company sources and Wall Street analysts
"We are engaged in a process to unlock resources to grow our company," said Campbell spokesmanJerry Buckley
He acknowledged that Campbell has commissioned a study of operations by the management consulting firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand
"We use consultants all the time,"hesaid
Buckley also said there is no deadline for the study and that no decisions are likely to be made soon
Since David Johnson became Campbell's chief executive, the company has been retreating from the paternal interest in the city of Camden, where it was founded a century ago by the Dorrance family
Johnson closed the company's original soup plant, costing Camden 900 jobs as part of a company-wide restructuring that cut 11,000 jobs
Campbell has also changed the terms of its commitment to build a new headquarters building on the banks of the Delaware River, a key ingredient in the city's planned economic recovery
Instead, the company offered to be the prime tenant for any developer willing to take the risk
 Two expressed interest, but neither was able to obtain financing
Last year Campbell sold its Mrs
 Paul's frozen fish subsidiary
