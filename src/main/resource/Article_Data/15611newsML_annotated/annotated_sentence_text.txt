FOCUS-Continental sees higher profits.
Germany's largest tyre maker, Continental AG, on Tuesday said pre-tax profits more than doubled to 120 million marks ($81 million) in the first half of 1996 and its full-year earnings would be clearly higher
In a letter to shareholders, the world's fourth-largest tyre maker said the surge in profits in the half year was driven by internal cost control measures, increased productivity and a favourable exchange rate environment.
The increase in profits in the half came despite insecurity about Germany's weak economy and profitability improved in all areas of the group's activities, it said
Management board chairman Hubertus von Gruenberg had forecast a doubling of profits at the group's annual general meeting in June
