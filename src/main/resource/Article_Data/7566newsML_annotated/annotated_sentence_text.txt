"According to our current projection, we are assuming that both profit before taxes and net income after taxes for total 1996 will be slightly higher than in 1995," BASF's chief financial officer Max Dietrich Kley told a news conference here.
"If there would be an economic upswing in the second half of the year, which is expected by some of our competitors, surely our prediction of today is very conservative," he added.
BASF's pre-tax profit rose to 2.32 billion marks ($1.55 billion) in the first half of 1996 from 2.02 billion, coming in right at the middle of analysts' forecasts.
Results were boosted by lower special charges, a strong dollar and substantial improvements from the pharmaceutical, crop protection and gas and oil businesses, BASF said.
German chemicals group BASF AG on Thursday reported a 14.7 percent rise in its first-half profit and conservatively predicted a slight increase in  full year earnings following more orders last month in most businesses.
