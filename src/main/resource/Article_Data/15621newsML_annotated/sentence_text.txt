LONDON 1996-08-28Anad for a British soft drinkdepicting a boy with horns and glowing eyesdrew complaints from viewerswho linked it to devil imagerytoo disturbingforchildren, theindustry watchdogsaid on Wednesday
TheIndependent Television Commission (ITC), which licenses and regulates Britain's commercial TV, said it hadrestrictedthetelevision adfor the fizzy drink Irn Bru by allowing it to be shown only late at night, after the ITC received 57 complaints
The ITC's move underscoresgrowing public concern about the use of demonic images in advertising
Many condemn such 'shock tactic' ads forthe distressthey can cause tochildren
The ruling Conservative Party's controversial campaign this month -- featuring Opposition leader Tony Blair with red, satanic eyes -- is being investigated by the Advertising Standards Authority, which regulates press and poster ads
Broadcasts of a Nike footwear ad last month, which showed a football match between "good" and "evil" teams and included a bat-eared devil with yellow eyes, were restricted to late evenings after viewers complained that it would harm children
The Irn Bru soft drink ad was originally banned from being shown during children's programmes by the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre (BACC), the body which vets ads for the ITC
But the ad was inadvertently aired before the broadcasting "watershed" time of 9
00 p
m
 because of a technical error, the ITC said
The ad was created for Irn Bru by advertising agency The Leith Agency
