An ad for a British soft drink depicting a boy with horns and glowing eyes drew complaints from viewers who linked it to devil imagery too disturbing for children, the industry watchdog said on Wednesday.
The Independent Television Commission (ITC), which licenses and regulates Britain's commercial TV, said it had restricted the television ad for the fizzy drink Irn Bru by allowing it to be shown only late at night, after the ITC received 57 complaints.
The ITC's move underscores growing public concern about the use of demonic images in advertising.

The ruling Conservative Party's controversial campaign this month -- featuring Opposition leader Tony Blair with red, satanic eyes -- is being investigated by the Advertising Standards Authority, which regulates press and poster ads.
