Floridians indicted for huge pyramid scheme fraud.
A federal grand jury indicted 36 people on fraud and conspiracy charges in connection with an alleged Ponzi scheme run by Premium Sales Corp., a Florida grocery company seized by federal authorities three years ago, officials said Friday.
The indictment alleged that three of Premium's top officers, Kenneth Thenen, 59, his son, Scott Thenen, 37, and Daniel Morris, 53, headed a massive fraud scheme that bilked investors of hundreds of millions of dollars and used the money to fund lavish lifestyles that included luxury homes, Lear jets, racing boats and jewelry
"It makes me feel ill when I think of the greed some of these people had," said Jerry Bandy, chief of criminal investigations of the Internal Revenue Service.
The indictment, announced by the IRS, Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Justice Department, said the defendants coerced investors into financing billions of dollars worth of grocery "diversions" that did not exist
