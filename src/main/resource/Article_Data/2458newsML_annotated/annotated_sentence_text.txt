Thai opposition gears up for no-confidence debate.
Thailand's opposition parties submitted a no-confidence motion on Tuesday against beleaguered Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa, accusing him of damaging the country through mismanagement and inefficiency.
"Prime Minister Banharn is inefficient and shows a lack of leadership... ," the opposition said in the motion submitted to the president of parliament.
"He has abused his duty and turned a blind eye to rampant corruption... all of which has caused damage to the country... "
Debate on the motion will begin on September 11, an opposition member of parliament (MP) told Reuters.
The opposition has said it was confident there was enough strong evidence to bring down Banharn's 13-month old coalition, which has been rocked by the withdrawal of one of its member parties.
