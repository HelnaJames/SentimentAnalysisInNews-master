Britain's United News &amp; Media announced plans on Tuesday to sell off 47 local newspapers in south east England and Wales.
The company, which has interests in commercial television and national newspapers, said it wanted to focus its efforts on local newspapers in northern England.
"The proposed divestment will allow us to concentrate on and develop our local media interests in the north, where we already have a strong portfolio of titles," said United News chief executive Clive Hollick.
