CRICKET-ESSEX POISED TO STEP UP TITLE CHALLENGE.
Essex are set to step up their English county championship challenge with a fifth consecutive victory after new-ball pair Neil Williams and Mark Ilott sent Gloucestershire reeling on Saturday.
Williams seized two wickets in two deliveries and left-armer Ilott also captured two as Gloucestershire, 252 behind on first innings, slumped to 27 for four at the close on the third day of the four-day game at Colchester.
Essex, who started the current round of matches in fifth place 20 points behind leaders Derbyshire with a game in hand, could go top if they complete victory on Monday's last day and other results favour them.
Williams thrust Essex on course for success by dispatching Matt Windows and Andrew Symonds in his second over, before Ilott removed Dominic Hewson and Tim Hancock to reduce Gloucestershire to 17 for four at one stage.
The visitors had started the day optimistically by sending back former England captain Graham Gooch when he added just six to his overnight 105, but Essex went on to make 532 for eight before declaring.
