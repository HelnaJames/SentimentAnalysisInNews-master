ATHLETICS-MULTI-DISCIPLINE WILDERNESS RACE BEGINS
PEMBERTON, British Columbia 1996-08-24About 350 athletes from nine countries set out on a 323-mile (517 km) climbing, rafting, biking and running endurance race thorugh the Canadian wilderness on Saturday
The event, called the Eco-Challenge, is part of a growing sport known as adventure racing in which competitors test their limits for days over a perilous wilderness course
The Eco-Challenge has been staged twice before -- in Utah and Maine last year -- and is modelled on similar races overseas
The 70 teams in this year's race will will trek glaciers, climb mountains, whitewater raft, horseback ride, canoe and mountain bike on the gruelling course
The location of this year's race was keep a secret until Friday evening
It is being held near Pemberton, British Columbia, about 100 miles (165 km) northeast of Vancouver
 The area is filled with treacherous mountain peaks, ice fields and frigid waters
Organisers expect about two-thirds of the participants to drop out or be disqualified before the finish
 The hardy ones are expected to complete the course in about six days with first-place finishers receiving $10,000 in prize money
In the Eco-Challenge, competitors race in teams of five which must include both men and women
 Team members must remain within 100 yards of each another at all times and finish together
With racers carrying about 40 pounds (18 kg) of gear on their backs, broken bones, sunstroke, dehydration and exhaustion are common
"I'm looking forward to this race
 I think it will be more physically challenging and we'll have to go up against more diverse situations due to the terrain," said Dr
 Michael Stroud, a veteran Eco-Challenge participant
