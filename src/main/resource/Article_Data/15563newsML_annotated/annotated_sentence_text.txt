MFS WorldCom seen as European upmarket threat.
Newly merged MFS-WorldCom Inc seems well placed to win high profits from the most lucrative section of Europe's telecommunications market, the corporate sector, experts said Tuesday.
The $14.4. billion merger of MFS Communication Co Inc and WorldCom Inc, announced Monday, owes its conception to recent U.S. deregulation legislation.
"This merger is really driven by the need to strengthen themselves in their newly opened-up home market," said John Matthews, for high-technology research consultancy Ovum.
The merged company will have sales of about $5.4 billion a year, with more than 500,000 business customers throughout North America, Europe and Asia.
But the merger will have big repurcussions in Europe, where some national telephone monopolies, due to expire in 1998, present a tempting combination of bloated prices and workforces and complacent management.
