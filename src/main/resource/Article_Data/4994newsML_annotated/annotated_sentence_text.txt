Weak German economy hits Krupp profits.
German steel and engineering group Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp said Wednesday its profits tumbled 17 percent in the first half of 1996 as the weak German economy  hurt the group's steel business
Pre-tax earnings fell to 185 million marks ($124.2 million) in the first six months of the year, from 223 million marks ($149.7 million) in the year-ago period, even though all six of its business divisions were profitable
Sales edged up 1 percent to 11.7 billion marks and orders rose 2 percent to 12.7 billion marks ($8.5 billion).
"The decline is a result of the unsatisfactory economic development during the period under review," Krupp said.
