, the nation's fourth-largest wholesaler of drugs, said Tuesday it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection afterefforts to sell the ailing company fell through
FoxMeyer Health Corp
 said last week it was in final negotiations to sell FoxMeyer Drug to a New Jersey investor group led by William F
 Taggart, a turnaround expert, for $25 million in cash and securities

5 billion in annual revenue
FoxMeyer did not say why the sale was terminated
FoxMeyer Drug also announced the appointment of Robert Peiser as the drug unit's vice chairman and chief executive
Peiser is the former chief financial officer (Corrects title from chief executive) of Trans World Air Lines and is widely credited with being the architect of that company's restructuring, said Michael Kolbenschlag, a spokesman for FoxMeyer Health
The company also secured a $775 million financing package arranged by GE Capital Services as part of the bankruptcy filing, under which it will reorganize its finances
FoxMeyer Drug said that although it was able to reach an agreement in June on a new and expanded credit package, recent restrictions on the terms by its suppliers forced it to file for bankruptcy
"As we explained in several meetings with a number of our suppliers, we believe that we would have been able to operate successfully outside of Chapter 11 with the continuation of normal trade terms," said William Estes, president and chief operating officer of FoxMeyer Drug
"Some suppliers, however, apparently preferred the certainty of a Chapter 11, where they knew that as post-petition suppliers they would receive priority status by the court for any new goods that were purchased," he said
The Dallas-based company said FoxMeyer Drug will operate as usual despite the bankruptcy filing
 The action does not affect the parent company
FoxMeyer Health last week reported a loss of $288
4 million, or $17
27 a share, on revenues of 4 million in the first quarter
 The results include a write-down of investment in FoxMeyer Drug of $238
7 million
The company also faces a class action lawsuit that charges that FoxMeyer and certain of its officers and directors violated securities laws

125 on the New York Stock Exchange
