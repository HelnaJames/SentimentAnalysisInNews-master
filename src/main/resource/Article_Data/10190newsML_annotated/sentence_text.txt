India police raid tycoon's home in phone scandal
Narayanan MadhavanNEW DELHI 1996-08-23Indian policesaid on Friday they raided the home of a company executive whose firm has been linked to a growing scandal involving the privatisation of the nation's telecommunications sector
The raid followed a search of two homes belonging to former communications minister Sukh Ram during which police seized more than $1 million in cash and the arrest of a civil servant
TheCentral Bureau of Investigation (CBI)said it raided on Thursday the home of Mahendra Nahata, chairman of Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd (HFCL), a little-known firm that won lucrative licences earlier this year
"Searches were conducted at his home," CBI spokesmanS
M
 Khantold Reuters
"Some documents were seized and are being scrutinised
"The Press Trust of India (PTI) said his offices were also raided on Friday
Neither Nahata nor company officials could be reached for comment
 "Some CBI officials did visit the house of Mr Nahata and held discussions with him," PTI quoted a senior company official, Arvind Kharbanda, as saying
Last week, the CBI seized cash worth over $1 million from two homes belonging to Sukh Ram
 He was abroad during the raids last week and was located on Friday in London
His relatives told the Indian high commission in London he was unwell and planned to return to India within a week, PTI said
 He was earlier in the United States as part of a trip which media reports said was for treatment linked to heart problems
Khan confirmed police searches of Nahata's home were linked to last week's corruption case against Sukh Ram
Former Prime Minister P
V
 Narasimha Rao's Congress party, defeated in April-May general elections this year, suspended Sukh Ram from its membership this week after the raids
No formal charges have been laid by the CBI but a senior telephone department official has been arrested in the case
 On Friday, police arrested the owner of a radio equipment firm alleged to have been favoured by Sukh Ram, PTI said
Sukh Ram oversaw a yet-unfinished privatisation process that began in 1994 and was accused by the opposition of unfairly favouring the HFCL in an auction of licences under an economic reform programme started in 1991
 He has denied the accusations
Although the raids on his homes were not linked to the privatisation of telephone services, they revived simmering charges that Sukh Ram mishandled the tendering process for licences in the privatisation scheme
Opposition parties protesting against Sukh Ram and the licensing process virtually paralysed parliament during a month-long session last December
On Monday, new Communications Minister Beni Prasad Verma ordered an overhaul of the committee which awards the licences
