Lloyd's to tell appellate court survival at stake.
Lloyd's of London was back in court on Tuesday in a bid to overturn a U.S. court ruling that it claims threatens its reorganization plan.
Lloyd's was set to argue that the court ruling Friday granting a preliminary injunction blocking the plan could eventually lead to the collapse of the 300-year-old insurance market.
A hearing on Lloyd's appeal of the ruling was set to begin Tuesday morning in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Baltimore. U.S. Circuit Judge Paul V.
 Veimeyer said Tuesday the court would issue its ruling in the case at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).
At issue is Lloyd's plan to reorganize by reinsuring billions of dollars of liabilities into a new company called Equitas
