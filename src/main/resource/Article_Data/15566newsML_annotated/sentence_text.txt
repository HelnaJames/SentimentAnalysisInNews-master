LONDON 1996-08-27Britain's key markets regulator theSecurities and Futures Authority (SFA)said on Tuesday it haddisciplinedthree more former directors of Barings, the British merchant bank which collapsed in February 1995
In a statement the SFA said the three --George Maclean, head of the banking group of Baring Investment Bank,Anthony Hawes, group treasurer of Baring Investment Bank andAnthony Gamby, director of settlements for Baring Investment Bank -- hadfailed to act with due skill, care and diligence
In March theSFA, which grants the licences vital to do business in London's financial district, said it hadstarted disciplinary action againstan unspecified number of unnamed individuals in connection with the collapse of Barings
Nick Leeson, the trader blamed forstacking up $1
4 billion of unauthorised trading losses which crippledthebank, is serving a six-and-a-half year jail sentence in Singapore

In May, the SFA banned Peter Norris, former chief executive of the failed bank, and former head of group finance at Baring Investment Bank Geoffrey Broadhurst
The regulator was criticised, though, for failing to take tough action against the two men at the top of Barings -- chairman Peter Baring and his deputy Andrew Tuckey
Maclean has been reprimanded and his SFA registration as a director suspended for two years, the regulator said
 He must also pay 10,000 pounds ($15,590) towards the SFA's costs
Hawes was removed from the SFA's registers of directors and managers and required to pay 10,000 pounds towards costs
Gamby's registration as a director has been suspended for a year from March 15, 1996 and he has been required to pay 5,000 pounds costs, the SFA said
