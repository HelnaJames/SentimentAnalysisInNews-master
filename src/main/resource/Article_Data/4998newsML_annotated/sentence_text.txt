Federal police havefiled a corruption case againstformer communications ministerSukh Ram, who oversaw the telephone privatisation programme until theCongress partywasdefeatedin general elections in April and May
No charges have been laid, despite the filing by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
Last week, CBI agents recovered more than $1 million in cash during a raid on two of Sukh Ram's homes

 Deve Gowda asking for the suspension of all telecommunications licences granted during Sukh Ram's tenure
Under India's telephone privatisation programme, the previous Congress government awarded licences to dozens of private joint ventures, involving Indian and foreign companies, to operate cellular and basic services
A fourth round of bidding to grant basic service licences in remaining zones has not yet been scheduled
"I sincerely hope that none of the earlier decisions will be reconsidered because of revelations made now," Chidambaram told reporters
"I hope that those who have been given licences will move forward to implement those licences
"The minister said he was not aware of any impact from the suspected scandal on the privatisation process
 "But I hope that the process will not be stalled," he said
Chidambaram said the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector was high on the 13-party United Front government's agenda and it would ensure that the process moved forward
"The process of liberalisation in the telecommunications sector and introduction of private investments in the basic telecommunications services must go forward and I am confident will go forward," Chidambaram said
Sukh Ram's whereabouts were still a mystery on Wednesday, five days after the CBI raided his homes
Chidambaram said the Deve Gowda government was trying to remove the perception of corruption, which was one of the reasons that led to the defeat of the previous government
"We want it (corruption) to be minimised if not totally eliminated
 But sometimes I am afraid some of these traders also encourage and feed corruption," Chidambaram said
