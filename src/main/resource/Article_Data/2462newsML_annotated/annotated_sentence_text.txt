China not seen importing rice in wake of floods.
China is unlikely to need to buy rice on the international market to make up for flood damage to domestic crops, Far East traders said on Tuesday
"As far as large demand from the (central grain) reserve, COFCO (China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import Export Corp) or the grain bureaux goes, I rule it out," said a Chinese trader in Shanghai.
No China inquiries for rice were reported by traders in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand.
China's Futures Herald newspaper, quoting State Grain Reserve Administration statistics, said on Saturday that although flood damage had reduced the early rice harvest and was likely to slow planting of late rice, total output for 1996 was expected to be unaffected.
This is because China has increased the area under rice cultivation this year, the newspaper said, adding that the reduction in the early harvest should not have a significant effect on the total grain harvest due to higher production of other crops, it said.
No China inquiries for rice were reported by traders in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand.
