German unions split on tactics in retail pay talks
The two main unions representing German retail workers split apart on Tuesday
 The HBV union pulled out of talks in a four-month old pay dispute while the DAG opted to continue negotiations.
The unions have been jointly negotiating a wage and work hours deal for the 450,000 retail workers in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, one of several regional deals being hammered out in advance of November's liberalisation of shop hours.
However the service sector union HBV pulled out of the talks on Tuesday after employers refused to accept its unexpected demand for extra compensation for night work.
