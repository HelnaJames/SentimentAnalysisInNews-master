Axa first half revenues rise 24.5 percent.
French insurer Axa SA on Tuesday reported a 24.5 percent rise in first-half revenues, powered by consolidation of Australian life insurer National Mutual acquired last year.
Axa, one of France's Big Four insurers, said in a statement revenues rose to 81.93 billion francs ($16.10 billion) from 65.81 billion francs.
The increase "primarily reflected the consolidation of National Mutual during the period," said the company, the most geographically diversified of France's insurers.
Axa acquired control of National Mutual last year for $A1.1 billion.
Revenues rose 8.8 percent on a constant currency and structure basis.
