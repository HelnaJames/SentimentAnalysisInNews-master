The Bank of Japan's quarterly corporate survey or "tankan" released earlier in Tokyo caught financial markets on the hop.
Tankan boosts Japan government bonds but pitfalls ahead.
International investors will likely be lured back into Japanese government bonds after a weak corporate sentiment survey sharply curtailed the chances of an interest rate rise this year, analysts said on Wednesday.
But the survey may prove to be a double-edged sword -- enticing politicians to unleash new stimulus measures as the economy falters -- and investors should be wary about going too overweight at the expense of other bond markets, they said.
"Certainly it's dramatically changed the outlook of the market," said Kirit Shah, chief market strategist at Sanwa.
"People were looking for JGB yields to head back up to 3.5 percent and mabe even four percent in a year's time but the tankan has radically shifted the trading range," said Shah, based in London.
