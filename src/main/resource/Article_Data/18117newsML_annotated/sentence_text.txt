Jacqueline ThorpeLONDON 1996-08-28International investorswill likely be lured backintoJapanese government bondsafter a weak corporate sentiment survey sharply curtailed the chances of an interest rate rise this year,analystssaid on Wednesday
But the survey may prove to be a double-edged sword -- enticing politicians to unleash new stimulus measures as theeconomyfalters-- andinvestorsshould bewaryabout going too overweight at the expense of other bond markets,theysaid
"Certainly it's dramatically changed the outlook of the market," saidKirit Shah, chief market strategist at Sanwa
"People were looking for JGB yields to head back up to 3
5 percent and mabe even four percent in a year's time but the tankan has radically shifted the trading range," saidShah, based in London
The Bank of Japan's quarterly corporate survey or "tankan" released earlier in Tokyocaughtfinancial marketson the hop
The key diffusion index for major manufacturers -- which gauges business sentiment -- fell to minus seven in August from minus three in May
 Analysts had been expecting a slight rise
Paul Meader, who manages 200 million pounds ($311
5 million) in fixed-income investments at Matheson Investment Management in London, added, "The curve is very steep and that makes me feel perhaps international managers may start to look at extending up the curve a little bit
"Bond markets surged in Japan and held onto gains in London
 The yield on the key 182nd 10-year bond fell below three percent in Tokyo for the first time since February
It was quoted at 3
03 percent in London at 1150 GMT
The survey revealed an economy still in dire straights and put a rise in the 0
5 percent official discount rate off until next year, analysts said
In such a weak economic environment, the bond market would continue to make gains, said Stuart Thomson, chief international economist at Nikko (Europe)
"I would expect it to maintain this bullish stance in the near term," he said
He forecast the yield on the 10-year bond dipping to 2
80 percent in the next few weeks
 Matheson's Meader put 2
75 percent as his target
But troubles loom beyond the short term, analysts said
While Japan's Finance Minister Wataru Kubo said the tankan would not lead to any immediate decision on the need for an extra budget, analysts said the urge may prove irresistable, particularly with an election due by mid-1997
"This weak economic scenario increases scope for another fiscal stimulus package and the budget deficit will become even more horrendous and supply will hit the market some time down the road," Shah said
Meader added that with one of largest budget deficits of developed countries, interest rates at rock bottom and the yen continuing weak, the economy already had plenty of stimulus
"From a bond market perspective that fiscal stimulus, interest rate stimulus and currency stimulus is a very dangerous cocktail and it justifies real yields much higher and nominal yields much higher," he said
Meader said Matheson may increase its weighting slightly in JGBs from its slim eight percent weighting
 The JP Morgan global bond index has a benchmark of 15 percent, he said
But Shah would opt for U
S
 Treasuries instead
 "The budget deficit in the U
S
 is in much better shape
 The roles have reversed from the 1980s to the 1990s," he said
Nikko's Thomson preferred core Europe and particularly the short-end of Germany
