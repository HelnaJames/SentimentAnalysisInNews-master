Gaza journalists briefly boycott cabinet meeting.
Palestinian journalists in the Gaza Strip self-rule enclave on Saturday boycotted covering the day's meeting of the Palestinian Authority cabinet for several hours after a security man assaulted three journalists.
The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate in Gaza, which called the boycott, ended it after the man's commander arrested him.
The member of the elite Force 17 unit had stopped a Reuters Television crew and a World Television News man about 100 metres (yards) from Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's office on Saturday morning and made them sit in the sun for 30 minutes.
When one of the three complained, the security man cursed him
Another journalist joined the argument.
