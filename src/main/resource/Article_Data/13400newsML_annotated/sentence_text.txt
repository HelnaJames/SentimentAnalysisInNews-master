FOCUS -Positionshardenin Saxon subsidy struggle
Terence GallagherBONN 1996-08-26Battle lineshardenedon Monday in the dispute betweeen Germany and the European Union over subsidies by the state of Saxony for auto maker Volkswagen AG
Germany and the EU eachthreatenedto file fresh complaints in the case with the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, after Saxony did so on Friday
Thetussle beganin June when the European Commission approved only 540 million marks ($365
5 million) of a proposed 780 million marks in subsidies for VW to build two plants in the formerly communist east German state
Saxony premier Kurt Biedenkopf decided to hand over all the money anyway, because he said 23,000 jobs depended on it
German economics ministerGuenter Rexrodtsaid BonnbackedVolkswagen's claim to all the cash, despiteBrussels' contentionthiscould start a spiralling war of subsidies
"I believeVWhas aright to this money, and that the two plants must be built in Mosel and Chemnitz,"Rexrodttold German television
Initially, Rexrodt was less than pleased at Biedenkopf's action and had urged him to reach a compromise with Brussels, but he now appears to be digging in for a standoff
Compromise "will be difficult, but nothing should be left untried
 We need Brussels, Brussels needs us," he said
Rexrodt said he would recommend to the cabinet on Tuesday that Germany file a complaint in Luxembourg to clarify what role Brussels should play in monitoring Bonn's support for the rebuilding of the east, which still depends on massive help six years after unification
In Brussels, a spokesman told reporters the commission planned no immediate action but would discuss the VW row at its September 4 meeting, and would prepare to launch its own action in Luxembourg if the matter was not fixed to its liking
"If legality is not re-established we are preparing everything so that if necessary the complaint on our side will be launched," he said
Rexrodt and EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert failed to resolve differences in a meeting last Friday, the day Saxony filed its complaint
Biedenkopf on Monday defended the decision to go to court
"Putting a European Commission decision to the test in court is not the same as putting Europe in question," Biedenkopf told a gathering of VW managers
He said the Commission was not a government but a bureaucratic body
 The relationship between Saxony and VW was one of cooperation, not blackmail as Van Miert suggested last week, he said, adding that Saxony was convinced the subsidies for VW were legal
Saxony was one of the most industrialised regions in Germany before World War Two, and suffered greatly under the communist east German government
 Unemployment there is now over 15 percent
