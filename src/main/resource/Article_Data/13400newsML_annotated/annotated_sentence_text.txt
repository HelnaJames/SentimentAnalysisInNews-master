Saxony premier Kurt Biedenkopf decided to hand over all the money anyway, because he said 23,000 jobs depended on it.
German economics minister Guenter Rexrodt said Bonn backed Volkswagen's claim to all the cash, despite Brussels' contention this could start a spiralling war of subsidies.
"I believe VW has a right to this money, and that the two plants must be built in Mosel and Chemnitz," Rexrodt told German television.
 Positions harden in Saxon subsidy struggle.
Battle lines hardened on Monday in the dispute betweeen Germany and the European Union over subsidies by the state of Saxony for auto maker Volkswagen AG.
Germany and the EU each threatened to file fresh complaints in the case with the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, after Saxony did so on Friday.
The tussle began in June when the European Commission approved only 540 million marks ($365.5 million) of a proposed 780 million marks in subsidies for VW to build two plants in the formerly communist east German state.
