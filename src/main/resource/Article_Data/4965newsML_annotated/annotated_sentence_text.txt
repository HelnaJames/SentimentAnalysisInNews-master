After Saturday's success, Japanese officials are now confident the "basic agreement" is about to become reality.
Japan eyes big U.S. deal with H2 rocket.
Japan, once a laggard in satellite launching, has shot into the front ranks of space nations, with its H2 rocket's latest success challenging Chinese and European dominance in the field.
The H2's success last Saturday in lifting two satellites into orbit, followed three days later by a Chinese rocket's failure in a similar mission, leaves Japan poised to land a $1 billion contract from Hughes Electronics Corp. to launch a dozen satellites.
Two months ago, the European Space Agency's new Ariane 5 rocket blew up on its maiden flight, effectively ruling it out as a contender for the Hughes contract.
Rocket System Corp., a consortium of 74 Japanese high-tech firms, announced last month it had reached a "basic agreement" with Hughes to launch the 12 satellites using an advanced model of the H2 rocket.
