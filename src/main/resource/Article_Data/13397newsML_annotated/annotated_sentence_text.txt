Seoul stocks rattled by business tycoon sentencing.
The sentencing of nine South Korean business tycoons added to the country's economic worries Monday and sent Seoul stocks diving to a 33-month-low.
Most other Asian markets declined amid trade made sluggish by holidays for the London and Hong Kong markets.
Seoul's composite stock index fell 15.24 points, or 1.95 percent, to 766.89, the lowest close since Nov. 4, 1993, when it ended at 766.55.
The entire market is depressed right now because of the economic slow-down.
The sentencing of the business leaders is making the sentiment worse," said a broker at Hanyang Securities.
