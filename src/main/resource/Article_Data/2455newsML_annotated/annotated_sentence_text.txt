Standard Chartered makes Philippines a priority.

Standard Chartered Bank, the oldest but least active foreign bank in Manila, has embarked on an expansion programme to ensure it is not left behind as competition in the Philippine banking sector intensifies.
"We moved the Philippines in terms of (the bank's global) priority from kind of the bottom up to almost the top," the bank's Philippine chief executive, Eirvin Knox, said in an interview on Tuesday.
While London-based Standard Chartered was reducing staff levels globally, its Manila unit aimed to double its current 220 employees in the next two years, Knox said.
It has increased its capital to 1.5 billion pesos, five times the government-mandated minimum.
It is expanding treasury operations and installing a new dealing room, and plans to introduce new products including a credit card which should be available early next year.
