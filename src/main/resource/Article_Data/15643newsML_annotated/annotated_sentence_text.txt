Castlemaine XXXX is an Australian lager and is currently the subject of a new advertising campaign seeking to move the product away from its macho male image.
Bass may see Castlemaine licence review - FT.
British brewer Bass Plc could face a review of a licensing deal to make and distribute the lager brand Castlemaine XXXX under its deal for control of Carlsberg-Tetley, the Financial Times reported.
Bass struck a complex agreement over the weekend giving it control of Carlsberg-Tetley, which is owned by Allied Domecq and Denmark's Carlsberg.
The Financial Times said in its Tuesday edition that the licence to produce and sell Castlemaine in the UK, currently held by Carlsberg-Tetley from New Zealand group Lion Nathan, the original brand owner, could be open for review when it changes ownership.
