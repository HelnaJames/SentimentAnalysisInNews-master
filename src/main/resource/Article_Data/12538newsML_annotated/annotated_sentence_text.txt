U.S. jury rules against smoker in tobacco lawsuit.
An Indiana jury on Friday ruled in favor of four tobacco companies in a liability suit filed by the widow and family of a longtime smoker who died of lung cancer.
The jury at Marion County Superior Court found for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Liggett Group Inc., Philip Morris Inc. and The American Tobacco Co., now owned by Brown &amp; Williamson, a unit of B.A.T Industries Plc.
RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp is the parent company of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. Liggett is a subsidiary of Brooke Group Ltd..
The suit was filed by the widow and three children of Richard Rogers, an Indianapolis lawyer who died at the age of 52 in 1987.
 They sought unspecified damages, contending that the tobacco industry peddled an addictive product that caused Rogers' cancer.
