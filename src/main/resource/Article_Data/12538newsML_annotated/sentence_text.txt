The suit was filed by the widow and three children of Richard Rogers, an Indianapolis lawyer who died at the age of 52 in 1987
They sought unspecified damages,contending that the tobacco industry peddled an addictive product that caused Rogers' cancer
Yvonne Rogers left after the verdict without commenting
 Warren Holland, one of her attorneys, said the family was disappointed but "we don't want people to give up
 It's just another chapter, this is not the end
"Attorneys for the tobacco companies praised the verdict
 "I think its very impressive
" said Bill Ohlemeyer, an attorney for Philip Morris
 "It was obviously a hardworking and conscientious group of people
 They listened to the evidence and followed the law and reached the correct verdict
"The jury foreman in the case, David Anderson, said the jury's decision was not a message that people should not sue tobacco companies
"Absolutely not," he said
 "The message I have for you is that we tried to do what was justice
"In the case -- which was tried once before and wound up in a hung jury -- the Rogers family contended the industry peddled an addictive product that was the cause of his lung cancer
Rogers originally filed the suit himself
 He had quit smoking about a year before his death, after he was diagnosed with cancer
Lawyers for the Rogers family said during the trial that he knew he was addicted and tried often to quit, but the industry, by selling an addictive product, took that choice away from him
Lawyers for the industry countered that Rogers for at least 20 years was exposed to warning labels on cigarette packs and should have been fully aware of the risks stated on them
The case, similar to hundreds which have been filed across the country, follows one earlier this month in Jacksonville, Florida, where a jury awarded $750,000 to a man who smoked for 44 years before he was stricken with lung cancer
In that case the jury said the Lucky Strikes he smoked were a defective product and that cigarette maker Brown &amp; Williamson was negligent by failing to inform the public about the health risks of smoking
