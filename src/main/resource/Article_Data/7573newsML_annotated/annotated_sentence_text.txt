China cuts interest rates, says no policy change.
China announced on Thursday it was cutting bank deposit and lending rates in response to easing domestic inflation.
But it also said the reduction, the second since May, did not mean a retreat from what it called "appropriately tight monetary policies".
The central People's Bank of China said it would cut bank deposit rates by an average of 1.5 percentage points and lending rates by 1.2 percentage points, effective on Friday, according to the official media.
New rates on basic savings accounts would be an annual 1.98 percent while fixed deposit rates would range from 3.33 percent for three-months to 9.0 percent for five years.
Lending rates for operating funds would be cut to 9.18 percent for six months and 10.08 percent for one year while fixed asset loans would range as high as 12.42 percent for five years or more
