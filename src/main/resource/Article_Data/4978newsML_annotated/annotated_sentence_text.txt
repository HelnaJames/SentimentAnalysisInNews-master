Compaq sees halved 1996 European PC sales growth.

Growth in European personal computer sales is expected to slow by more than half, but the industry will still expand at a rate most industries only dream about,according to Compaq Computer Corp.
Sales growth in Europe by all manufacturers will slow to less than half of the rapid 35 percent rate set last year, said Compaq, the world's biggest maker of personal computers.
Compaq Wednesday began selling its Presario line of computers in Britain, France, Italy and the Netherlands.
It hopes the Presarios, which sell for $2,000 to $5,000, will be simple enough to allow it to make a play for a largely untapped mass market for PCs.
"Growth for the whole year (in Europe) will be about 15 percent, which looks nice but is still far behind the predicted 35 percent that was predicted by forecasting companies like Dataquest
Last year, growth was 35 percent," Compaq's Consumer Group vice president, Toon Bouten, said in an interview.
