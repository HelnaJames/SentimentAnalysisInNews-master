 Records Chairman Russ Thyrettold Reuters
Thyret declined immediate comment on specific details but industry sources told the Los Angeles Times that Warner signed a five-album contract worth an estimated $80 million
The deal eclipses pop singer Janet Jackson's estimated $70 million contract with Virgin Records, signed in January
"This is a watershed moment forWarnerBros
 Records -- an incredible new beginning for the company,"label president Steven Bakertold the newspaper
The Los Angeles Times said the deal was announced at a meeting of Warner executives in Anaheim, California on Saturday
 Thyret was reached in his hotel room in Anaheim on Sunday, where he was conducting meetings
An industry source told Reuters the contract was fairly priced
 "Based on the kind of money that R
E
M
 generates, Warner will certainly make their money back," he said
But Thomas White, an artist rights expert, said he thought the contract price was inflated
 "These kinds of deals are hazardous to labels
 It makes no real economic sense, except to maintain appearances and keep the name connected to the band," he said
The Grammy-winning band had for the past two weeks been the target of a bidding war among major labels, including DreamWorks SKG, Capitol Records and Sony Music, the Los Angeles Times reported
Though details of the deal have not been made public, the daily quoted sources as saying the band would earn a $10- million signing bonus, plus a $20-million royalty advance on future sales of it's Warner catalog
The band is also guaranteed an estimated $10 million advance per album and 24 percent royalty for each record sold
Under terms of the deal, ownership of the master recordings of those five albums will revert to R
E
M
 seven years after the end of the contract, the newspaper reported

M
 was formed in the small college town of Athens, Ga
, about 70 miles east of Atlanta, in 1980 by guitarist Peter Buck, now 39, singer Michael Stipe, 36, and bassist Mike Mills and drummer Bill Berry, both 37
Since then, the band -- still made up of the original four members -- has sold more than 30 million albums and won four Grammy awards
 A new release, titled "New Adventures in Hi-Fi," is due in two weeks
