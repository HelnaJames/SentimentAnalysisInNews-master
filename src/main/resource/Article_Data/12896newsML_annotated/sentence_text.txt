CANADA: Canada auto union supports strong strike mandate
Canada auto union supports strong strike mandate
TORONTO 1996-08-25TheCanadian Auto Workers union(CAW) said on Sunday its members employed by the Big Three North American carmakers voted overwhelmingly to give union leadership the authority to call a strike to back contract demands
TheCAWsaid members at Ford Motor Co
's Canadian subsidiaryvoted 96
65 percent in favorof astrike mandate
Chrysler Corp
 members voted 93
79 percent in favor of a strike
CAW members at General Motors Corp
's Canadian unit voted 92
38 percent in favor of possibly taking strike action
"It showsthey're mad as hellatthe companiesand they want this thing resolved," saidCAW president Buzz Hargrove
The CAW is the largest private sector union in Canada with 52,800 of its 210,000 members in the auto industry alone
The union said its members voted in favor of a strike if the union leadership believes it cannot reach acceptable collective agreements with the automakers after the contracts expire on Sept
 14
"They're supporting the union on the issues as well as the strategy I've outlined over the last 10 days," said Hargrove
 "This means we have the mandate from our membership to call a strike if we have to
 We don't want to
 We want to bargain a settlement
"Hargrove told reporters on Thursday that on Aug
 28 the union will announce which of the three carmakers will be its target for bargaining and possibly a strike
Traditionally, the CAW chooses one of the companies to seek a master agreement as a framework for its labor contracts with all three
Hargrove said he will press ahead with announcing his target despite a Thursday announcement from the United Auto Workers union in the United States that it has not yet chosen its own bargaining target
It would be the first time the CAW had chosen a strike target before the UAW and could rob the Canadian members of bargaining leverage if the same company is chosen as a target by the much larger U
S
 union
CAW president Buzz Hargrove has also said he expects it to be tough to apply a master agreement forged at Ford or Chrysler to its labor contract with GM this round and he thinks it will be "difficult" to avoid a labor dispute
"Whether or not they are the target, if they are first second or third we have a different problem at GM than we do at Ford or Chrysler," Hargrove told Reuters on Wednesday
Although contracting out work or outsourcing in the auto industry is a major issue at all three carmakers, GM has made outsourcing decisions in the last year that will eliminate over 5,000 CAW jobs and the union is determined to try and reverse them
