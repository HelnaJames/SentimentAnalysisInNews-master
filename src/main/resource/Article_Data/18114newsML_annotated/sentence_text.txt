Oil traders continued to keep a close eye on the preparations for the return to world markets of Iraqi crude under a limited oil-for-food sale arranged under U
N
 auspices
Delays in implementing a May 20 agreement between Iraq and the U
N
 have helped support crude markets but analysts say prices could come under pressure once exports begin
OPEC deputy secretary general Ramzi Salman said on Tuesday that a combination of renewed Iraqi exports and extra crude from non-OPEC producers, some from delayed North Sea fields, could undermine markets later in the year
"It is expected that these delayed fields will come onstream in the fourth quarter, while the timing for Iraqi crude, in the oil for food and medicine deal was also about the same time," Salman told OPEC news agency in an interview
"This may lead to a softening of the market, which in turn, would require that OPEC members adhere strictly to their quotas in order to keep prices as firm as possible," Salman said
But he said Iraq's return after six years had already been factored in to the market
"There will be no shock when Iraq returns to the market because the world and OPEC have already taken this into consideration
