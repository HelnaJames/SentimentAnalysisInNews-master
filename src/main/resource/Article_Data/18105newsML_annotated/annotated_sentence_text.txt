IBM stock jumps; Salomon sees shares at $145.
The stock of International Business Machines Corp. jumped Wednesday after Salomon Brothers raised its recommendation on the world's biggest computer maker, setting a 12-month target price of $145 for the shares
In early trading, IBM was up $3.75 to $115.50 on active trading of more than 1.4 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Its current 52-week high is $128.875.
John Jones, an analyst at Salomon, said he upgraded IBM to strong buy from buy, citing rising near-term confidence in the computer maker's fundamentals.
He said his rising confidence in IBM's near-term prospects was tied in part to a series of announcements the company has scheduled for Sept. 10, which include a new version of the microprocessors used to power its core mainframe computer products.
