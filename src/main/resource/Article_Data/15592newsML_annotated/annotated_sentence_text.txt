Toronto stocks take a breather from upward climb.
Toronto stocks ended mixed on Tuesday, with a focus on falling pipeline and gold issues after the market gained nearly 300 points thus far in August.
 "I think it'll take a few more days before it sells off enough" for investors to return and hunt for bargains.
"This is a momentum that cannot be maintained, so this market is giving back some of its gains," said P and C Holdings President Ron Meisels.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index lost 12.8 points to close at 5173.9 points for its second straight losing session.
