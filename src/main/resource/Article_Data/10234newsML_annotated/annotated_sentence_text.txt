Netanyahu targets illegal foreign workers.
Israel's government on Friday considered for the first time ways to cut a growing dependence on foreign workers who have taken jobs which are off-limits to Palestinians and unwanted by Jews.
"We will act to reduce drastically the presence of illegal foreign workers as well as cut the scope of foreign labourers who enter the country with a permit," a cabinet statement quoted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as saying
The communique said the cabinet would take a "practical decision" next week.
"We will propose expelling about 1,000 illegal foreign labourers from Israel a month," Labour and Welfare Minister Eli Ishai told Israel Radio before Friday's debate.
But Ishai's plan was no blueprint for a mass exodus from Israel of workers from countries such as Romania, Thailand, Turkey and China who now do the low-paying manual labour of Palestinians barred from the Jewish state for security reasons.
