Yeltsin, 65, has been seen in public just once in seven weeks, at his August 9 inauguration for a second term in the Kremlin
 But he looked tired and spoke in a flat, wooden voice, leading to speculation that he was ill
Aides denied the speculation and dismissed a string of reports in Russian and Western media that Yeltsin had suffered a recurrence of heart problems which put him in hospital twice last year
They have said the president is simply tired after a gruelling campaign for reelection
Yeltsin left for a two-day trip to the Valdai lakelands of northwestern Russia on Tuesday and aides said he would decide during the visit whether to take a longer vacation there
His absence coincided with a Russian military threat to launch an all-out assault on the separatist-held Chechen capital Grozny, raising questions about who was in charge of Russian policy there
