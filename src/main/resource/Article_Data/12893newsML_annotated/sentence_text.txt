Why Allied wants out of C-T - analysts
LONDON 1996-08-25Allied Domecq's sale of its half share in Anglo-Danish brewer Carlsberg-Tetleywill come as a relieftothe companywhich has tried long and hard to exit the joint venture
A-D acquired thestake in Carlsbergin 1993 but it has beenunderperforming
Below are highlighted brewing analysts most commonly cited reasons for Allied's withdrawal
--operating profits of 52 million stg for the year to August 19 1995 and market share of 16 percent against consensus forecast of 100 million stg in trading profit and an 18 percent share when the C-T joint venture was formed in 1993
--the Allied retail division is currently paying 25 to 30 stg a barrel more for beer from C-T than it could get in the market
This is because Allied in order to enter the joint venture with Carlsberg accepted higher beer prices into its retail estate to boost brewing's profitability
-- C-T embarked on an aggressive discount campaign in an effort to recover lost market share, which seemed not to have stopped volume loss but hit margins and profits
