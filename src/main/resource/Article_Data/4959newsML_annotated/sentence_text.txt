Ad legend Maurice Saatchi made lord
LONDONAdvertising force Maurice Saatchi was elevated to the House of Lords by Prime Minister John Major Wednesday in a move industry experts saidwould give marketing new respectability and influence
"We aredelightedthat someone so influential in advertisinghas been recognised
 


 It also recognises the industry's important contribution as aneconomic force for the good," saidAndrew Brown, director general of the Advertising Association, the industry's main trade group
But Major's decision to honour Saatchi as well as public relations expert Peter Selwyn Gummer, both advisers to the ruling Conservative Party on its latest pre-election campaign,triggered a political storm
Saatchi, who helped the Conservatives win four general elections in a row, is behind a much-vilified newspaper campaign this month which depicts opposition Labour Party leader Tony Blair with devillish red eyes
The ad -- now under investigation by the Advertising Standards Authority -- is part of the Conservative's "New Labour New Danger' offensive, which hasshocked many by the ferocity of its attackson theopposition
Gummer is the brother of Environment Secretary John Gummer and chairman of the Shandwick public relations company
He and Saatchi are among 14 people who will be made life peers, a honour that dies with the recipient, unlike heriditary peerages
The Labour Party criticised Major for recognising two of the architects of the "dirtiest" campaign in modern politics, who it said were being promoted merely for aiding the Conservatives
