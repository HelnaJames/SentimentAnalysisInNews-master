RTRS-Aust Prov News plans Asian expansion.
Media group Australian Provincial Newspapers Ltd said on Tuesday that it had identified a number of expansion opportunities in south-east Asia.
The company earlier reported a 12.3 percent rise in first half net profit to A$11.56 million.
Chairman Liam Healey said the group continued to seek complementary acquisitions that would enhance shareholder value, with its mobile advertising division Buspak expanding.
"In this regard I am very pleased to announce that APN, through Buspak, has made two significant expansionary moves.
 In New Zealand, Buspak will establish operations later this year.
 In Hong Kong, Buspak has signed a long term contract with Citybus, thus launching Buspak in south-east Asia," Healey said.
